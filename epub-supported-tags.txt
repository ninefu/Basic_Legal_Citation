Make the main content with XHTML, CSS, and images.

XHTML

Use XHTML 1.1, but without the following modules:

    Forms
    Server-side Image Map
    Intrinsic Events
    Scripting

Tags such as <b> and <i> are supported, but discouraged, because you can use <span> and CSS to do this. 

Structure Module
    body, head, html, title
Text Module
    abbr, acronym, address, blockquote, br, cite, code, dfn, div, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, kbd, p, pre, q, samp, span, strong, var
Hypertext Module
    a
List Module

    b, big, hr, i, small, sub, sup, tt
Edit Module
    del, ins

    button, fieldset, form, input, label, legend, select, optgroup, option, textarea
Tables Module (tables are supported, but may convert poorly. Martin uses the List Module in examples instead of them)

Image Module
    img

    Attribute ismap on img
Intrinsic Events Module (not supported)
    Events attributes

For maximum epub compatibility:

Include XML declaration and XHTML doctype, at the top:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" 
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

and xmlns attribute in html:

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

Any unicode character, in UTF-8 or UTF-16, is allowed. But readers may have limited rendering capabilities.

CSS

Only CSS 2.1 is almost fully supported, with few exaceptions.
