  Concrete Prods., Inc.</span>, 274 Ga. 210, 553 S.E.2d 270 (2001)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Donald Kendrix sought workers' compensation benefits following 

  an accident that occurred while he was working for Hollingsworth Concrete Products, 

  Inc. The Administrative Law Judge denied the claim because Kendrix tested positive 

  for marijuana and cocaine after the accident and failed to rebut the presumption 

  found in <span class="highlight">O.C.G.A. &#167; 34-9-17 (b) (2)</span> that the 

  accident was caused by the illegal use of controlled substances. The appellate 

  division affirmed, as did the superior court. We granted Kendrix's application 

  to appeal to consider whether <span class="highlight">O.C.G.A. &#167; 34-9-17 (b) 

  (2)</span> violates equal protection by differentiating between legal and illegal 

  drug use. Because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between workers 

  who are injured while taking prescription medication and those who are injured 

  while taking illegal substances, we affirm. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">When a controlled substance is given by prescription, the 

  use of that drug is regulated by several factors that are not present when a 

  drug is taken illegally. A physician determines the proper dosage and duration 

  the medication should be taken. The doctor also informs the patient of any limitations 

  on activities that should be observed while on the medication. Additionally, 

  the regulations governing the pharmacist who fills the prescription provide 

  another safeguard against misuse of a controlled substance.<strong> </strong><span class="highlight">Ga.

<p class="text-level1">The presumption in <span class="highlight">O.C.G.A. &#167; 34-9-17 

  (b) (2)</span> furthers the state's legitimate goal of reducing workplace accidents 

  and increasing productivity by discouraging illegal drug use. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Georgia
