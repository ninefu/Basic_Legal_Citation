<h3 class=Section>&sect; 2-300.<a name="2-300"></a> How to Cite Constitutions, 
  Statutes, and Similar Materials</h3>
<p class=text-level1>In the United States, constitutions and statutes are structured 
  in a way that allows citation of relevant provisions without regard to how any 
  particular version or edition has been printed or electronically distributed. In this fundamental sense, they 
  are and long have been vendor- and medium-neutral. That is because articles, 
  sections, clauses, and subsections rather than volumes and page numbers identify 
  specific passages. This holds for such similar legal materials as local ordinances, 
  on the one hand, and international agreements, on the other. While these several 
  types of legal materials share this structural quality, constitutions and statutes 
  differ dramatically from one another in one key respect &#150; frequency of 
  change. The compiled enactments of Congress and the legislatures of the states 
  are constantly subject to amendment. This reality raises a risk, albeit not 
  a large one in most situations, that the text of the statute to which a writer 
  refers and the text consulted by a reader following the writer's citation, at 
  some later date, may be differentor that the provisions governing the question being addressed are not those current in effect. 
  These risks are a consequence of the possibility 
  of intervening legislative change <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">per se</span> 
  compounded by the amount of time it takes the respective publishers or disseminators 
  to enter legislative changes in their statutory compilations. Addressing these possibilities 
  calls for both writer and reader to pay serious attention to the date of the 
  compilation relied on by the writer. The reader will assume that a citation to the provisions of a constitution or codified statute is referring to 
  the version in force at the time the writing was prepared unless it includes a date element that indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class=text-level1>The relevant citation principles follow; section <a href="3-300.htm" target="_self">3-300</a>

<p class=text-level1>Statutory provisions are, whenever possible, cited to compilations. 
  For any single U.S. jurisdiction, there is usually a single codification scheme, 
  ordering sections into topically clustered units, even though there may be multiple 
  versions of the code or compilation, print and electronic, public and commercial. 
  Until the recent proliferation of electronic sources, citation norms favored 
  citation to one particular print compilation for each jurisdiction. Most citation 
  manuals still appear to do so, but practice is rapidly adjusting to the reality 
  that electronic compilations are in general more up-to-date and therefore more 
  widely used than print ones, that in most jurisdictions no single version is 
  universally relied upon, and that up-to-date print compilations from other jurisdiction 
  are maintained in very few law libraries. </p>

  Points of Difference in Citation Practice</h4>

<p class=text-level1><span class="principle"><a name="2-335_1"></a>Point 1:</span> 
  Both <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">The Bluebook</span> and the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">ALWD 
  Guide to Legal Citation</span> direct a writer to cite to a publicly produced or supervised 
  statutory compilation (generally referred to as an &quot;official&quot; code) 
  if the provisions referred to are contained in it. In other cases, conventional 
  practice, encouraged by the major publishers and reflected in both citation 
  guides, is to identify the publisher of a commercially produced statutory compilation, 
  and, with the two principal annotated versions of the United States Code, to 
  use abbreviations of their brand names (U.S.C.A. and U.S.C.S.). Especially, 
  as sources and versions have multiplied, however, usage has moved toward the 
  citing of statutes by means of their generic or &quot;official&quot; designation 
  without regard to the source actually used by the writer. If followed rigorously, 
  this approach involves dropping the superfluous notation (&quot;Ann.&quot;), 
  which simply indicates that the code relied upon was annotated, and leaving 
  the publisher's name or brand out of the concluding parentheses <span class="example_icon"><a href="2-335_ex1.htm" target="2-335_frame_1" >&laquo;e.g.&raquo;</a></span>. 
  The existence or nonexistence of annotations in the compilation relied on by 
  the writer has no bearing on the statutory language itself, and, as a consequence 
  of the shifts in ownership and branding that have occurred in commercial law 
  publishing and the divergence between print and electronic versions of compilations 
  bearing the same brand, references to &quot;the publisher&quot; are no longer 
  straightforward. </p>
<p class=text-level1>While this is the practice of nearly all appellate courts and most lawyers, neither 
  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">The Bluebook</span> nor the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">ALWD 
  Guide to Legal Citation</span> goes so far. While both remove branding elements from 
  the name of state (but not federal) statutory compilations, they still include 
  references to the publisher in a concluding parenthetical. Both manuals also include &quot;Ann.&quot; when 
  the cited code is annotated. </p>
<p class=text-level1>To illustrate, the official compilation of Indiana statutes is regularly cited &quot;Ind. Code &sect; x.&quot; According to <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">The Bluebook</span> and the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">ALWD Guide to Legal Citation</span> citations to the commercial compilation of Indiana statutes long known as &quot;Burns Indiana Statutes Annotated&quot; should take the form &quot;Ind. Code Ann. &sect; x (LexisNexis year)&quot; while those to &quot;West's Annotated Indiana Code&quot; should read &quot;Ind. Code Ann. &sect; x (West year).&quot;</p>

<p class=text-level1><span class="principle"><a name="2-335_2"></a>Point 2:</span> 
  While it is the practice in the opinions of and briefs submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and a majority of state courts to omit any date element from statute citations unless the provisions have been or are likely to be subject to amendment, both <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">The Bluebook</span> and the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">ALWD Guide to Legal Citation</span> call for the routine inclusion of the year or some alternative indication of the cited compilation's cutoff date. Very likely this reflects the degree to which they remain bound by a print paradigm and their prime focus on law journal publication.</p>

  <iframe src="2-335_ex0_3.htm" name="2-335_frame_3" width="600" height="140" frameborder="10"></iframe>  
<p class=text-level1><span class="principle"><a name="2-335_3"></a>Point 3:</span> 
  A standard and recurring 
component of state statute and regulation citations is an abbreviation of the 
state name. One area of citation practice on which 
there is widespread state variation is the abbreviation of a state's code when cited by or to that state's own courts. The abbreviations used on the examples 
  in this introduction (<a href="3-300.htm#3-320" target="_self">&sect; 3-320</a>), 
  like the two dominant national citation references, are full enough to distinguish 
  unambiguously between a citation to a provision of the Alaska Statutes and one to a similarly numbered 
  section of the codes of Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas. When context leaves little or no doubt about which state's 
  statutes are being cited, the case with briefs submitted to and decisions 
  rendered by the courts of a particular state, significant citation space can 
  saved with little or no loss by having the state name supplied by implication 
  <span class="example_icon"><a href="2-335_ex3.htm" target="2-335_frame_3" > 
  &laquo;e.g.&raquo;</a></span>. In decisions of the Alaska Supreme Court and 
  briefs submitted to it, &quot;AS&quot; is commonly used instead of &quot;Alaska 
  Stat.&quot;; in Kentucky it is understood that &quot;KRS&quot; stands for &quot;Kentucky 
  Revised Statutes&quot; and not statutes of the state of Kansas. At the extreme, 
  this form of state-specific citation dialect leaves off all explicit reference 
  to the state. A reference in an Ohio brief to &quot;R.C.&quot; is understood 
  as referring to Ohio's &quot;Revised Code&quot;; one in a New York brief to 
  a section of the &quot;General Municipal Law&quot; and one in a California brief 
  to a section of the &quot;Penal Code&quot; are understood as referring to the 
  respective state's codified statutes.

  <li>situations where the reference is to enactment itself or to provisions that

  or code has been adopted by a state and is being referred to as the law of that 
  state, it is cited like any other state law. When a reference is to the uniform 
  law or model code apart from its adoption and interpretation in a particular 
  state, the citation should consist of the name of the uniform law or code (as 
  abbreviated), section number, and the year that law or code (or major subpart)
