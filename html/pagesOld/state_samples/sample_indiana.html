<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from<span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Caesars Riverboat Casino, LLC v. Kephart</span>, 934 N.E.2d 1120 (Ind. 2010)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">In 1988, voters approved a referendum to amend the Indiana Constitution by deleting the general prohibition against lotteries. The General Assembly then authorized lotteries conducted by the State Lottery Commission and horse race gambling in 1989. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">Pub. L. No. 341-1989, 1989 Ind. Acts 2308 (special session) (codified at Ind. Code 4-30, 4-31)</span>. In 1993 riverboat gambling was authorized subject to regulation by the Indiana Gaming Commission. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">Pub. L. No. 277-1993 &sect; 124, 1993 Ind. Acts 4821 (special session) (codified at I.C. 4-33)</span>. Aside from these exceptions, gambling in this state continues to be strictly prohibited by anti-gaming laws. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Schrenger v. Caesars Indiana</span>, 825 N.E.2d 879, 883 (Ind. Ct. App.2005), trans. denied</span>; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">see</span> <span class="highlight">I.C. &sect;&sect; 35-45-5-2, 35-45-5-2</span> (criminalizing gambling and professional gambling such as pool-selling and bookmaking); <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">L.E. Servs., Inc. v. State Lottery Comm'n of Ind.</span>, 646 N.E.2d 334, 340 (Ind. Ct. App.1995), trans. denied</span> (holding the offering of out-of-state lottery tickets for sale to the public strictly prohibited by Indiana's anti-gaming laws).</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">In this case, not only does the statutory scheme cover the entire subject of riverboat gambling, but the statutory scheme and Kephart's common law claim are so incompatible that they cannot both occupy the same space. As the sole regulator of riverboat gambling, the Commission has adopted detailed regulations at the legislature's direction. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">68 Ind. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 1-1-1 to 19-1-5</span>. <span class="highlight">Indiana Code sections 4-33-4-3(a)(9) and (c)</span> require the Commission to enact a voluntary exclusion program. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">68 I.A.C. &sect;&sect; 6-1-1 to 6-3-5</span>. Under this program any person may make a request to have his or her name placed on a voluntary exclusion list by following the required procedures. <span class="highlight">68 I.A.C. &sect; 6-3-2</span>. To request exclusion, applicants must provide contact information, a physical description, and desired time frame of exclusion &mdash; one year, five years, or lifetime. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Id</span>. Casinos must have procedures by which excluded individuals are not allowed to gamble, do not receive direct marketing, and are not extended check cashing or credit privileges. <span class="highlight">68 I.A.C. &sect; 6-3-4</span>. A casino's failure to comply with the regulations makes it subject to disciplinary action under 68 Indiana Administrative Code article 13.</p>
