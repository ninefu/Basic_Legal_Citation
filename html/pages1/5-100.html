  <p class="text-level1">
   The following citation elements should be italicized:
   <ul>
    <li class="text-level2">
     case names (including procedural phrases)
    </li>
    <li class="text-level2">
     book titles
    </li>
    <li class="text-level2">
     titles of journal articles
    </li>
    <li class="text-level2">
     introductory signals used in citation sentences or clauses
    </li>
    <li class="text-level2">
     prior or subsequent history explanatory phrases
    </li>
    <li class="text-level2">
     words or phrases attributing one cited authority to another source
    </li>
    <li class="text-level2">
     the cross reference words: "
     <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
      id
     </span>
     .," "
     <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
      supra
     </span>
     ," 

    and "
     <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
      infra
     </span>
     "
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="text-level1">
   If underlining is used instead of italics it should continue 

  under successive words that are part of the same phrase but break between items. 

  When "
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    e.g
   </span>
   ." appears with another signal 

  the two together are treated as a single item. Punctuation that is part of any 

  of the above elements is italicized along with it, but punctuation that separates 

  that element from other parts of the citation should not be.
