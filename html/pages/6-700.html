	<p class="text-level1">
		Most rules of appellate procedure require that briefs contain a table
		of authorities following their table of contents, with a notation of
		the page or pages (paragraph or paragraphs) at which each is cited.
		Some also specify the order in which those authorities are to be
		listed, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> e.g. </span> , cases in
		alphabetical order. The table should be organized by category of
		authority.

		Less widespread but present in the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure </span> and a number of state
		counterparts is the requirement that “If the court's determination of
		the issues presented requires the study of statutes, rules,
		regulations, etc., the relevant parts must be set out in the brief or
		in an addendum at the end, or may be supplied to the court in pamphlet
		form.” Fed. R. App. P. 28(f).
