		§ 1-400. <a name="1-400"> </a> Levels of Mastery
	</h3>
	<p class="text-level1">What degree of mastery of this language
		should one strive for  as a student, legal assistant, or lawyer?</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Recall that a citation serves several
		purposes. Of those purposes, one is paramount  furnishing accurate
		and complete information that will enable retrieval of the cited
		document or document part. The element of citation that calls for
		immediate mastery is painstaking care in recording and presenting the
		complete address or retrieval ID of a document. Citing a case using
		the wrong volume or page number, citing a statute with an erroneous
		section number or without a necessary title number  errors like these
		cannot be explained away by the intricacies of citation. Their
		negative impact on readers is palpable. Consider the frustration you
		experience when you are given an erroneous or partial street address
		or an email address that fails because of a typo; a judge's reaction
		to an erroneous citation is likely to be quite similar.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Since, in many cases, the standard retrieval
		formula for a cited document includes an abbreviation, a small set of
		abbreviations must be mastered as soon as possible. A minimum set
		includes those that represent the reporters for contemporary federal
		decisions, those that represent codified federal statutes and
		regulations, and those that represent the regional reporters of state
		decisions. Whenever your research is centered in the law of a
		particular state, you will want also to memorize the abbreviations
		that represent the case reports, statutory compilations, and
		regulations of that state.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Less critical in terms of function but no
		more difficult to master are the abbreviations that indicate the
		deciding court when that information is not implicit in the name of
		the reporter. You should strive to master the abbreviations for the
		circuits of the U.S. Courts of Appeals and those for the U.S. District
		Courts. Any time your research is centered in the law of a particular
		state you will want to master the abbreviations for its different
		courts.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Last and least are the conventions for
		reducing the space consumed by case names and journal titles.
		Including the full word "Environmental" in a case name rather than the
		abbreviation "Envtl." is, standing by itself, a trivial oversight. A
		consistent failure to abbreviate on the one hand or the use of
		idiosyncratic or inconsistent abbreviations on the other can produce
		inconvenience for the reader. Since your aim in nearly all law writing
		will be to persuade your reader, to win your reader over, you do not
		want to irritate or to convey an impression of carelessness.
		Therefore, a final review of one's citations against the standard
		abbreviations and omissions set forth in one the dominant manuals or a
		local equivalent is an important step. In time, you will find that you
		have internalized most of those rules.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Writing legal citation follows thorough
		legal research. As you carry out your research, your notes should
		capture all the information you will need to write the necessary
		citations. That entails recording all the required items for a full
		citation. It doesn't mean that you should take the time in the midst
		of research to check proper abbreviations; that can be a later step.
		What you will want to achieve, as soon as possible, is knowledge of
		what information elements will be required in a full citation. Knowing
		what to note or copy at the time you do your research will save you
		from having to pay return visits to sources simply to determine which
		circuit decided a particular case, what paragraph or page numbers are
		associated with the portion of a decision supporting your point, or
		how recently the statutory compilation on which you are relying was
		updated.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Learning to read legal citation should be
		your first goal. Since you are surrounded by citations in any cases or
		articles you read, that should be easy. Even this requires an active
		frame of mind, however; it is easy to skim past citations. As you read
		legal material exercise your growing command of legal citation by
		asking yourself occasionally about a cited source: What is it? How
		would I retrieve it? And when you are reading in an environment that
		permits ready access to cases, statutes or other cited material and
		you are curious about a point on which there are cited references (or
		your head simply needs a change of pace) follow a citation or two.
		Reading and following citations should not require use of a manual.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		Ultimately you will be able to write most citations without use of
		this reference or a manual  most but not all. The old and the unusual
		will drive even the most experienced legal writer back to the pages of
		<span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> or the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation </span> and,
		in states where one exists, a local citation guide.
