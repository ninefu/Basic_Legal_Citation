   The Port Authority airports' sole purpose of facilitating 
  air travel is reflected in all of their characteristics - planning, operation, 
  design, usage, financing, lack of integration with neighboring communities, 
  presence of captive audiences, and unique congestion and security problems. 
  These characteristics both attest to the special purpose of the Port Authority 
  air terminals and distinguish them from traditional public fora. In previous 
  cases, this Court has examined the nature of alleged public fora to determine 
  their public forum status.

   4. Captive Audiences
  </p>
  <p class="text-level1">
   The presence of captive audiences in air terminals distinguish 
  such terminals from the traditional public fora of streets and parks. Captive 
  audiences exist throughout the air terminals ย at enplaning and deplaning 
  points, at ticket counters, security checkpoints, baggage conveyor belts, and 
  car rental and other ground transportation counters. At all of these locations, 
  travelers tend to remain in place in order to complete travel-related tasks 
  (Superintendent's Statement at 58-60 (JA 458); Anderson Affidavit at 9 (JA 488)).

  ideas: "Lampposts can of course be used as signposts, but the mere fact that 
  government property can be used as a vehicle for communication does not mean 
  that the Constitution requires such uses to be permitted.

   Plaintiffs' reference to the alleged decline of downtown 
  street life by the development of skyways and other street alternatives in city 
  centers is clearly irrelevant to the issue at bar. The merits or demerits of 
  such developments should be debated by planning commissions or zoning boards 
  who determine the nature of our cities.

   </span>

  the development of urban streetscapes provides no basis for holding that the 
  Port Authority air terminals are public fora.
  </p>
  <p class="text-level1">
   Second, the alleged role of rail terminals as public fora 
  is irrelevant because rail terminals, unlike Port Authority air terminals, are 
  located in the center of a city. If the concourse of Grand Central Station or 
  the waiting room of a small town rail depot served as a meeting place for people 
  going about their daily business, it was because the rest of the community was 
  a sidewalk's width away.

   Moreover, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, as an historical 
  matter, it is far from clear that rail stations and terminals served as public 
  fora in the First Amendment sense. Plaintiffs fail to document that solicitation 
  and distribution of literature actually occurred at railroad terminals. Plaintiffs 
  also ignore the fact that railroad terminals were privately owned, and, therefore, 
  any solicitation or distribution of literature which took place was at the pleasure 
  of the private entities which owned the terminals.

   The distribution of literature has similar effects on 
  pedestrian flow. Air passengers must alter their path to avoid the distributor, 
  or pause to take literature and perhaps stop to read it or to throw it in a 
  wastebin. Significantly, Plaintiff's themselves concede that "literature distribution 
  . . . might well be as disruptive to a traveller 'hurrying to catch a plane 
  or to arrange ground transportation' as a request for a voluntary donation."

   It is well established that even in a public forum, the 
  government is not powerless to regulate First Amendment activity. Although it 
  is true that all communication may not be excluded from a public forum, content-neutral 
  regulations may be enforced if they are reasonable and narrowly tailored to 
  serve significant governmental interests, and leave open ample alternative channels 
  of communication.

   If the only purpose of section 632-a 
  was to compensate victims, however, petitioners' contention that the State's 
  needs could be met by other, less burdensome means would be more persuasive. 
  Manifestly, article 22 and the general civil procedures address that need. Section 
  632-a provides not only a method for victims to obtain compensation, however, 
  it also meets other compelling governmental interests. First, it preserves the 
  victim's equitable right to assets earned by a criminal as a result of the victimization.

   We reject the above arguments for 
  the Secretary's exercise of an interim rate authority essentially for the same 
  reasons that the court below rejected them. The Natural Gas Act, like most modern 
  ratemaking statutes, provides for a plenary ratemaking authority and vests in 
  it one body, there, the Federal Power Commission. As the Supreme Court held 
  in Tennessee Gas, an interim authority follows naturally from a plenary authority 
  under the usual "necessary and proper" clause. What the government has failed 
  to understand in urging upon us a similar argument in the present case is that 
  such a holding necessarily depends upon the existence of a plenary authority. 
  In this case the rate developer has none; the scheme set out in section 5 of 
  the Flood Control Act of 1944 divides rate authority and vests it in two separate 
  branches of the government. The government's suggested approach assumes the 
  validity of their conclusion even before the process of deduction has begun.
