  Bros., Inc. v. Township of W. Windsor</span>, 173 N.J. 502, 803 A.2d 53 (2002)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">This is a second round Mount Laurel exclusionary zoning 

  case brought by Toll Brothers, Inc. (Toll Brothers) against the Township of 

  West Windsor, the Township Committee of the Township of West Windsor, and the 

  Planning Board of the Township of West Windsor (collectively "West Windsor" 

  or the "Township"). Toll Brothers, the owner of a 293 acre tract of land located 

  in West Windsor, alleged below that the Township had engaged in exclusionary 

  zoning in violation of the New Jersey Constitution and the Fair Housing Act 

  of New Jersey (FHA), <span class="highlight">N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 to -329</span>, 

  and sought a builder's remedy from the trial court. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Under <span class="highlight">N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.15(d)1 to 

  -5.15(d)2</span>, COAH outlines its bonus credit system for rental units. For 

  every one rental unit made available to the general public, COAH grants the 

  municipality two units of credit, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">id</span>. 

  at -5.15(d)1; age-restricted rental units produce 1.33 units of credit. 

  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Id</span>. 

  at -5.15(d)2. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Our analysis of these issues entails a two-tiered inquiry, 

  each subject to a separate and distinct standard of review. The determination 

  whether market demand should be considered in assessing whether a municipality's 

  zoning ordinances are exclusionary is a question of law that we review de novo. 

  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Balsamides v. Protameen 

  Chem., Inc.</span></span><span class="highlight">, 160 N.J. 352, 372, 734 A.2d 

  721 (1999) (stating that "matters of law are subject to a de novo review")</span>. 

  We give deference to the trial court's factual findings, e.g., that West Windsor's 

  sewer requirements are cost generative, as such findings should not be disturbed 

  "when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence." <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Rova 

  Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am.</span>, 65 N.J. 474, 484, 323
