  Council of Agawam v. Energy Facilities Siting Bd.</span>, 437 Mass. 821, 776 

  N.E.2d 1002 (2002)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Pursuant to its statutory mission to "provide a reliable 

  energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment 

  at the lowest possible cost," <span class="highlight">G. L. c. 164, &#167; 69H</span>, 

  the board is charged with issuing construction permits for energy generation 

  facilities. <span class="highlight">G. L. c. 164, &#167; 69J 1/4</span>, inserted 

  by St. 1997, c. 164, &#167; 210. On June 20, 1995, Berkshire filed a petition to 

  construct, requesting such a permit from the board. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The board's regulations regarding the issuance of certificates 

  divide the certificate application process into two parts: an initial petition, 

  <span class="highlight">980 Code Mass. Regs. &#167; 6.02 (1993)</span>; and an application, 

  <span class="highlight">980 Code Mass. Regs. &#167; 6.03 (1993)</span>. When an energy 

  generating company files an initial petition for a certificate, the board may 

  either grant the initial petition (and proceed to consider the subsequent application) 

  or consolidate that petition with the application and consider them both in 

  a combined hearing. <span class="highlight">980 Code Mass. Regs. &#167; 6.02 (4)</span>. 

  The board in this case chose the latter course. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The scope of our review of board decisions is limited to 
  determining whether they conform to the Massachusetts and Federal Constitutions, 
  the provisions of <span class="highlight">&#167;&#167; 69H-69O</span>, and the board's 
  rules and regulations; whether they are supported by substantial evidence in 
  the record of the board's proceedings; and whether they were arbitrary, capricious, 
  or an abuse of the Board's discretion. <span class="highlight">G. L. c. 164, 
  &#167; 69P</span>. See <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Andover 
  v. Energy Facilities Siting Bd.</span></span><span class="highlight">, 435 Mass. 
  377, 378-379, 758 N.E.2d 117 (2001)</span>. The party appealing from a decision 
  of the board bears the burden of showing that the decision is invalid. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Id.</span>
