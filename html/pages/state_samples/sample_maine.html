<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">[&para; 2] On April 7, 2009, Evergreen filed an application with the Department of Environmental Protection for permits to construct the Oakfield Wind Project, a fifty-one-megawatt wind energy generation facility, in the Town of Oakfield. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">35-A M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 3452-3455 (2008)</span>; <span class="highlight">38 M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 480-A to 480-GG, 481-490 (2008)</span>. Evergreen's project involves the construction of thirty-four wind turbines, to be located along the ridgelines of Sam Drew Mountain and Oakfield Hills; access roads and a crane path; approximately twelve miles of an electrical collector line; an electrical collector substation; four meteorological towers; and an operations and maintenance building. This project is an &quot;expedited wind energy development&quot; because it is &quot;a grid-scale wind energy development that is proposed for location within an expedited permitting area.&quot; <span class="highlight">35-A M.R.S. &sect; 3451(4) (2010)</span>.</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">[&para; 4] With its application, Evergreen submitted a &quot;Sound Level Assessment&quot; prepared by an engineering company, which concluded that &quot;sound levels from operation of the Oakfield Wind Project will not exceed Maine DEP sound level[] limits during construction or routine operation.&quot; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">38 M.R.S. &sect; 484(3)(B)</span>; <span class="highlight">2 C.M.R. 06 096 375-6 to -15 &sect; 10 (2001)</span>. To &quot;verify&quot; compliance with the Department's sound level limits, the engineering company recommended that Evergreen monitor actual sound levels during operation of the project.</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">[&para; 9] On appeal, the Trust contends that the Board was required to hold a public hearing. We addressed this exact argument in <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Concerned Citizens to Save Roxbury v. Board of Environmental Protection</span>, 2011 ME 39, &para;&para; 18-23, 15 A.3d 1263, 1270-71</span>. In that case, we determined that the Board has discretion to decide whether to hold a public hearing when reviewing the Commissioner's decision on an application for an expedited wind energy development. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Concerned Citizens to Save Roxbury</span>, 2011 ME 39, &para; 23, 15 A.3d at 1271</span>; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">see also</span> <span class="highlight">38 M.R.S. &sect; 345-A(1-A), (2) (2010)</span>; <span class="highlight">38 M.R.S. &sect; 341-D(4), (4)(D) (2009)</span>; <span class="highlight"> 2 C.M.R. 06 096 002-4 to -5, -12 &sect;&sect; 7(B)-(C), 24(B)(7) (2003)</span>.</p>
