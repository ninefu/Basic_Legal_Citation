<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">White-Spunner Constr., Inc. v. Constr. Completion Co., LLC</span>, 103 So. 3d 781 (Ala. 2012)</h4>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">As required by <span class="highlight">&sect; 
  39-1-1(a), Ala. Code 1975</span>, White-Spunner subsequently obtained 
  two payment bonds from Hartford, one of which would compensate 
  Auburn in the event White-Spunner failed to perform under the 
  contract, the other of which would be used to compensate 
  subcontractors and suppliers in the event White-Spunner failed 
  to do so in a timely fashion. </p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">


We begin our examination of the labor-broker issue by 
looking to &sect; 34-8-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975, the chapter of 
the Alabama Code governing the licensing of contractors. This 
Court succinctly described its approach when interpreting 
statutes in <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">DeKalb County LP Gas Co. v. Suburban Gas, Inc.</span>, 
729 So. 2d 270, 275-76 (Ala. 1998)</span>. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">Importantly, White-Spunner and Hartford emphasize, it is undisputed that Buena Vista 
  employees did not work simply as consultants, equipment 
  installers, or performers of menial labor. Rather, framing is<br>
  specifically recognized as a construction activity by the 
  Licensing Board for General Contractors. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">Ala. Admin. Code 
(Licensing Board for General Contractors), Regulation 230-X-1-.27</span>.</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1"> CCC nevertheless argues that Buena Vista did not engage 
in contracting because, it argues, the employees supplied by 
Buena Vista effectively became CCC employees and employees of 
a licensed contractor are not required to be licensed 
themselves. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Cooper v. Johnston</span>, 283 Ala. 565, 569, 219 So. 2d 
392, 395 (1969)</span>.</p>
