<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">&para; 11. In order to be eligible for Medicaid, the applicant must meet certain financial and non-financial criteria. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-13-115 (Rev.2009)</span>. Married applicants who receive long-term care (i.e., institutionalized spouses) have specific limitations on their income and resources. The Division must determine the couple's income and resources and allocate resources between the institutionalized spouse and the community spouse when determining eligibility. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396r-5 (2006). . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">&para; 17. When reviewing an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, this Court applies a de novo standard of review. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Schmidt v. Catholic Diocese of Biloxi</span>, 18 So.3d 814, 821 (Miss.2009)</span>.</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">&para; 29. We find that the opinions of the Arkansas Supreme Court and the Missouri Court of Appeals provide a more compelling interpretation of the spousal-impoverishment provisions. Notably, 42 U.S. Code Section 1396r-5(e) specifically provides a mechanism for administrative review and revision of the CSMIA, MMMNA, and CSRA. Furthermore, Mississippi Code Section 43-13-116 sets forth the administrative-hearing process and provides that an aggrieved claimant "is entitled to seek judicial review in a court of proper jurisdiction." <span class="highlight">Miss.Code Ann. &sect; 43-13-116(3)(e)(xvii) (Rev. 2009)</span>. This Court previously has ruled that "`where a remedy before an administrative agency is provided, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts will act.'" <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Davis v. Barr</span>, 250 Miss. 54, 157 So.2d 505, 507 (1963)</span> (quoting 2 Am.Jur.2d Administrative Law, &sect; 595, p. 426). This Court also has described the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which is relevant to the case <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">sub judice</span>:</p>
<p class="text-level2">the courts cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal prior to the decision of that question by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the purposes of the regulatory statute administered.</p>
<p class="text-level1"><span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. M.T. Reed Const. Co.</span>, 51 So.2d 573, 575 (Miss.1951)</span> (quoting 42 Am.Jur. Public Administrative Law, &sect; 254). However, Mrs. Alford argues that the doctrine of administrative remedies should not apply, as the Division's rule states:</p>
<p class="text-level2">The CS [community spouse] share of total countable resources is the maximum allowed under federal law. In order for a CS to receive a share larger than the federal maximum, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">a court order would be required granting the CS a greater share of total resources after Medicaid had made a decision regarding spousal shares</span>.</p>
<p class="text-level1"><span class="highlight">Code Miss. R. 13 000 036 at &sect; 9210 (Rev. 1999)</span> (emphasis added). Mrs. Alford argues that the Division's own rules limit its authority to grant the requested relief, and as such, an administrative appeal is futile and a waste of resources.</p>
