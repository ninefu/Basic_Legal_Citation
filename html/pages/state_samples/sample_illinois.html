<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">&para; 11 Here, we similarly  hold that the circuit court may not dismiss a petition at the first stage of  proceedings solely on the basis that it lacked a verification affidavit.  Allowing a trial judge to sua sponte dismiss a petition on that ground  conflicts with our prior holdings that, at the first stage of proceedings, the  court considers the petition's substantive virtue rather than its procedural  compliance. It is also at odds with a first-stage determination of whether the  petition's allegations set forth a constitutional claim for relief.  Additionally, as with timeliness, the provision that includes the verification  affidavit requirement is in a separate section from the frivolousness provision  of the Act, therefore evincing legislative intent to draw a distinction between  them. Any deficiency in compliance with section 122-1(b)'s verification  affidavit requirement may be objected to by the State in a motion to dismiss at  the second stage of proceedings. See <span class="highlight"><em>People v. Cruz</em>, 2013 IL 113399, 369 Ill.Dec. 28, 985 N.E.2d 1014</span> (State's failure to object to postconviction  petition's lack of a notarized verification affidavit was forfeited and could  not be raised on appeal). Accordingly, the verification affidavit requirement  is neither rendered surplusage nor eviscerated by this decision.</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para; 12 Further, our holding  is consistent with the legislature's intent in passing the Act. The purpose of  the Act is to provide incarcerated individuals with a means of asserting that  their convictions were the result of a substantial denial of their  constitutional rights. <span class="highlight">725  ILCS 5/122-1(a) (West 2010)</span>. Construing the statute as requiring a verification affidavit at the  first stage of proceedings frustrates the legislature's intent to provide  incarcerated individuals with this avenue of redress.</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para; 13 We disagree with the  State's suggested remedy of a &quot;pre-second stage dismissal.&quot; The State  argues we should permit circuit courts, &quot;in lieu of first stage  review,&quot; to dismiss a petition lacking a proper verification affidavit,  without prejudice, with leave to refile a petition in conformance with the Act  within a specified time period. However, we believe that doing so would elevate  a petition's form over substance and would ignore this court's directive in <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Boclair</span>  to consider the petition's &quot;substantive virtue&quot; rather than its  procedural compliance. Moreover, such an approach would require us to read  language into the statute that the legislature did not include, which we may  not do. <span class="highlight"><em>People v. Ellis</em>,  199 Ill.2d 28, 39, 262 Ill. Dec. 383, 765 N.E.2d 991 (2002)</span>.</p>
