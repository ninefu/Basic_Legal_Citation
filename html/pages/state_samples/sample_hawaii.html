<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Our construction of statutes is  guided by the following rules:</p>

<p class="text-level2">First, the fundamental starting point for  statutory-interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Second, where  the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give  effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of  statutory construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect  to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the  language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt,  doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression  used in a statute, an ambiguity exists.</p>
