<p class="text-level1">&para;17 Section 27 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts 
  provides that: </p>
<p class="text-level2">Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient 
  to conclude a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the fact that 
  the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial 
  thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements are preliminary 
  negotiations. </p>
<p class="text-level1">Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 27 (1981). In support 
  of the proposition that Arizona has adopted this section, the court refers to 
  three recent decisions of the court of appeals. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See

<p class="text-level1">&para;19 Ry-Tan also argues that the Arizona School District 
  Procurement Code (the Code), <span class="highlight">Ariz. Admin. Code (A.A.C.) 
  R7-2-1001 to R7-2-1195</span>, dramatically altered the landscape of school 
  procurement contracts and effectively displaced the common law rule of Covington. 
  The state board of education adopted the Code in 1987 pursuant to legislative 
  authority. <span class="highlight">A.R.S. &#167; 15-213.J (Supp. 2004)</span>. By 
  its terms, the Code governs the "expenditure of public monies" for a school 
  district's procurement of "construction, materials and services." <span class="highlight">A.A.C. 
  R7-2-1002.A</span>.</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para;20 The legislature, of course, can modify or abrogate 
  the common law. To do so, however, it must express its intent clearly and, "absent 
  a clear manifestation of legislative intent to abrogate the common law, we interpret 
  statutes with every intendment in favor of consistency with the common law."

It shall be numbered with arabic numerals, and it shall not constitute a part of the brief for the purpose of determining length under Rule 14(b). If the brief is filed electronically, and if the appendix contains multiple documents, such documents shall be electronically bookmarked in the appendices' table of contents.</p>
