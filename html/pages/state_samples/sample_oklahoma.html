<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Rogers v. Quiktrip Corp.</span>, 2010 OK 3, 230 P.3d 853</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">&#182;3 The defendants moved to dismiss the action asserting (1) the petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and (2) the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (Commission) has exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute. The trial judge denied this motion. He ruled (1) the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the cause and (2) the plaintiffs' theories of liability may be supported by the duty created by the terms of <span class="highlight">52 O.S. &sect; 391</span>. The defendants moved to secure the trial judge's certification of the 4 December 2008 order which denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for immediate interlocutory review. They urge the issues presented affect the entirety of the merits of the controversy and an immediate appeal will advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. The trial judge certified his nonfinal ruling for appeal under the provisions of Supreme Court Rule 1.50. This court granted certiorari to review the certified interlocutory order.</p>

<p class="text-level1">&#182;4 When reviewing a trial court's dismissal of an action an appellate court examines the issues de novo. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Lockhart v. Loosen</span>, 1997 OK 103, &para; 4, 943 P.2d 1074, 1077</span>; <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Washington v. State ex rel. Dept. of Corrections</span>, 1996 OK 139, &para; 7, 915 P.2d 359, 361</span>; <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Indiana Nat. Bank v. State Dept. of Human Services</span>, 1994 OK 98, &para; 2, 880 P.2d 371, 375</span>. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">&#182;5 The defendants first assert the plaintiffs' claims fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission and not of the district court. According to the defendants, the plaintiffs' claims do not deal merely with the adjudication of private rights between individuals. They are an inherent challenge to the public-policy determinations over which the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction. In their supplemental brief the defendants cite the following statutes and administrative rules dealing with fuel in support of their claim that the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over this dispute: <span class="highlight">83 O.S. &sect;&sect; 111, 112</span> (directing the Commission to promulgate standards, rules and regulations concerning measuring devices for petroleum products); <span class="highlight">OAC &sect; 165: 15-7-2</span> (deals with the characteristics of gasoline and labeling of measuring devices); <span class="highlight">2 O.S. &sect; 11-22(E)</span>, (authorizing the Commission to promulgate rules to govern the sale of ethanol and gasoline mixtures); <span class="highlight">52 O.S. &sect; 325</span>  (conferring jurisdiction on the Commission to prescribe rules and specifications for safety and quality of fuels and burning oils, including gasoline); <span class="highlight">OAC &sect; 165:15-1-1</span> (purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive regulatory program governing the sale and use of gasoline and other fuels); and <span class="highlight">OAC &sect; 165:15-9-3</span> (providing that the alcohol content of motor fuel sold at airports for fueling aircraft must be labeled but disclosure of fuel additives for other retail sellers to be permissive).</p> 

<p class="text-level1">. . . . </p>


<p class="text-level1">&#182;9 The defendants next assert the trial judge incorrectly determined that the provisions of <span class="highlight">52 O.S. &sect; 391</span> &#8212; whose terms provide that it is unlawful for an entity to sell any liquid fuels which deceive the purchaser concerning the nature, quality or identity of the product sold &#8212; imposed a duty on sellers to disclose the ethanol content of their fuel. They rely on <span class="highlight">17 O.S. Supp. 2003 &sect; 620</span> whose terms specifically provide that sellers of motor fuel are not required to post information concerning the presence of fuel additives. According to the defendants, they were under no duty to disclose the content of fuel additives before 1 July 2008 when the terms of <span class="highlight">52 O.S. Supp. 2008 &sect; 347</span> became effective. In absence of any duty to provide this information, the defendants contend they cannot be held liable for the plaintiffs' asserted claims against them for breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranties and for violation of the Consumer Protection Act, <span class="highlight">15 O.S. &sect; 751 <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">et seq</span></span>.</p>
