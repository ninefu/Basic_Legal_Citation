<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State v. Johnson</span>, 2009-NMSC-049, 147 N.M. 177, 218 P.3d 863 (2009)</h4>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1"><i>{1}</i> After allegedly striking three private security guards while visiting Gallup High School, Defendant Derrick Johnson was charged with three counts of battery on school personnel, contrary to <span class="highlight">NMSA 1978, Section 30-3-9(E) (1989)</span>, which prohibits battery upon "school employee[s]." The district court dismissed the charges, concluding that because the security guards were providing contractual services at the high school, they were not "school employees" as defined in Section 30-3-9(A)(2). The State appealed.</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1"><i>{6}</i> The district court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss, concluding that Moeckle, Cachini and King "[were] not `school employees' as defined by <span class="highlight">NMSA 1978, &sect; 30-3-9(A)(2)</span>[.]" The Court of Appeals affirmed in a split decision. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State v. Johnson</span>, 2008-NMCA-106, &para; 1, 144 N.M. 629, 190 P.3d 350</span>. To determine whether the security guards were "school employees" within the meaning of Section 30-3-9, the Court of Appeals majority stated that its task was to give the words of the statute their ordinary meaning. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Johnson</span>, 2008-NMCA-106, &para; 8</span>. It concluded that this determination "is informed by the undisputed relationship between the school board and the school security guards." <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Id</span>. &para; 9. Thus, the Court of Appeals' analysis was guided by cases that analyze whether an employer-employee relationship exists by determining whether the employer had the right to control the details of the work to be performed by the employee. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1"><i>{15}</i> The purpose of the battery upon school personnel statute is to decrease incidents of violence at schools by enhancing the penalties for crimes committed against "employees" of the school. The law enacting Section 30-3-9 was entitled "An Act Relating to Public School Violence and Vandalism[.]" <span class="highlight">1989 N.M. Laws, ch. 344</span>. Thus, one of the Legislature's explicit purposes was to reduce violence in schools. Indeed, the State Board of Education has recognized that school boards throughout New Mexico have the "authority and responsibility to provide a safe environment for student learning" in order to effectively educate New Mexico's children. <span class="highlight">6.11.2.6 NMAC</span>.</p>
<p class="text-level1"><i>{16}</i> We also look to related provisions of the Administrative Code to examine whether security guards are traditionally viewed as school employees. In the section of the Code that declares the rights and responsibilities of public schools and public school students, the State Board of Education defines "[s]chool personnel" as "all members of the staff, faculty and administration <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">employed by the local school board</span> [,] ... includ[ing] school security officers[.]" <span class="highlight">6.11.2.7(T) NMAC</span> (emphasis added). Among the provisions of these regulations, a student may be appropriately disciplined for endangering the health or safety of "school personnel," meaning that if a student commits an act that endangers the health or safety of a security guard, that student may be disciplined. <span class="highlight">6.11.2.10(C)(1) NMAC</span>. We acknowledge that these regulations are not an interpretation of Section 30-3-9. However, they nonetheless demonstrate two important principles: (1) they support our conclusion that the ordinary meaning of "school employee" includes school security guards; and (2) they demonstrate that deterring assaults on security guards furthers the policy to provide a safe environment in which students can learn. It is to this policy, shared by Section 30-3-9, that we now turn.</p>
