<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="casename">Adams 
  v. NHC Healthcare</span>, 199 S.W.3d 163 (Ky. 2006)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1"> Noting that the facts complied with both <span class="highlight">KRS 
  342.730(1)(c)1 and 2</span>, the ALJ determined that the claimant could return 
  immediately to other regular employment at the same or a greater wage and awarded 
  benefits under <span class="highlight">KRS 342.730(1)(c)2</span>. Although the 
  Workers' Compensation Board affirmed on the first two issues and found no error 
  in the corrected order denying reconsideration, it determined that the evidence 
  and <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Fawbush v. Gwinn</span></span><span class="highlight">, 
  103 S.W.3d 5 (Ky. 2003)</span>, compelled an award under <span class="highlight">KRS 
  342.730(1)(c)1</span>. The Court of Appeals reversed on that issue but affirmed 
  otherwise. </p>
<p class="text-level1">The claimant raises four arguments. He asserts that <span class="highlight">803 
  KAR 25:010, &#167; 14(2)</span> entitled him to introduce evidence regarding his 
  social security disability award after proof time closed; that overwhelming 
  evidence compelled the ALJ to find him totally disabled; that the corrected 
  order on his petition for reconsideration violated <span class="highlight">KRS 
  342.125</span>; and that the ALJ misapplied Fawbush v. Gwinn, supra, when finding 
  that he could work as a med tech despite ordering the employer to pay for a 
  walker. Having concluded that nothing required the ALJ to consider evidence 
  submitted after proof time closed; that substantial evidence supported the finding 
  of partial disability; that the entry of a corrected order denying consideration 
  did not violate <span class="highlight">KRS 342.125</span> or the regulations; 
  and that substantial evidence supported the application of <span class="highlight">KRS 
  342.730(1)(c)2</span>, we affirm.</p>
