			Emeritus, and former dean of Cornell Law School, writes, speaks, and
			consults on topics that concern the impact of technology on the
			functioning of law and legal institutions.</p>

		<p>After his graduation from Harvard Law School, Professor Martin
			spent three years in the Air Force General Counsel's Office, and then
			began his teaching career at the University of Minnesota Law School
			in 1967. He joined the Cornell Law School Faculty in 1972, and served
			as Dean from 1980 to 1988.</p>

			Institute (LII) with Thomas R. Bruce in 1992, the first Internet law
			resource and still the most heavily used non-profit legal Web site.
			In addition to serving as the LII's co-director for over a decade,
			Professor Martin has created an electronic treatise and database on
			Social Security law, a Web reference, ebook, and accompanying online
			tutorials on legal citation, and written numerous articles on uses of
			digital technology in law and legal education. Between 1996 and 2007
			he offered law courses employing electronic materials prepared by him
			to students at over a dozen law schools via the internet. His most
			recent articles are available on SSRN. He blogs at:
