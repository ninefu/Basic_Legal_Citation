		<span class="principle"> <a name="6-400_1"> </a> Principle 1:
		</span> When a series of citations includes material grouped after more than
		one signal, the signals should appear in the order in which they are
		listed in <a href="6-300.html" target="_self"> § 6-300 </a> .

		<span class="principle"> <a name="6-400_2"> </a> Principle 2:
		</span> <a href="6-300.html" target="_self"> Section 6-300 </a> breaks
		signals (and their references) into four different "types": <a
			href="6-300.html#6-300_a" target="_self"> (a) </a> supportive; <a
			href="6-300.html#6-300_b" target="_self"> (b) </a> comparative; <a
			href="6-300.html#6-300_c" target="_self"> (c) </a> contradictory; and
		<a href="6-300.html#6-300_d" target="_self"> (d) </a> background.
		Signals of the same type must be strung together within a single
		citation sentence and separated by semicolons. According to <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> signals of different
		types should be grouped in different citation sentences. In other
		words, a period should end the string of authorities indicating
		support, and any authorities in contradiction, preceded by the
		appropriate signal, should follow in a separate citation sentence. The
		<span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation
		</span> allows all to be contained in a single sentence with only a semicolon
		separating the four different categories and their signals.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		<span class="principle"> <a name="6-400_3"> </a> Principle 3:
		</span> When more than one citation is preceded by the same signal, the
		citations are grouped by type in the following order:
	</p>
	<ul class="Text-Level2">
		<li class="text-level1 line-space">constitutions (U.S. first,
			followed by states in alphabetical order*)</li>
		<li class="text-level1 line-space">statutes (U.S. first, followed
			by states in alphabetical order*)</li>
		<li class="text-level1 line-space">cases (U.S. first, followed by
			states in alphabetical order* and grouped within each jurisdiction by
			court in descending order, with decisions of a single court**
			arranged chronologically, most recent first)</li>
		<li class="text-level1 line-space">regulations (U.S. first,
			followed by states in alphabetical order*)</li>
		<li class="text-level1 line-space">books (arranged alphabetically
			by last name of author)</li>
		<li class="text-level1 line-space">journal articles (arranged
			alphabetically by last name of author)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text-level1">* If the writing concerns the law of a
		particular state, citations to the constitution, statutes, cases, and
		regulations of that state should, however, precede the rest.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		** Reflecting their academic focus both <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> and the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation </span> call
		for the circuits of the U.S. Courts of Appeals to be treated as a
		single court for this purpose and for the different districts of the
		U.S. District Courts to be lumped together as well. There are many
		practice situations where this approach is inappropriate. In a brief
		to the Second Circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals or a U.S. District
		Court on whom its decisions are binding, decisions of that circuit
		should be treated as one court, while those of other circuits can
		reasonably be merged together as those of a single court. Indeed, this
		approach, as applied to courts with subunits, is inappropriate in any
		context where decisions of all those circuits or districts or
		divisions do not carry the same precedential weight.
