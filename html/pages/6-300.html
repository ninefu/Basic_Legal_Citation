  Citing an authority without any preceding word to clarify 
  or qualify its connection to the text represents that the citation directly 
  states the proposition or identifies a quotation or authority with which the 
  citation is associated

  . 
  There is a standard set of clarifying or qualifying words used with citations. 
  Placed in front of a citation these words are italicized (or underlined). When 
  instead they form the verb of a sentence that includes the citation they are 
  not italicized (or underlined). No comma separates the signal from the rest 
  of the citation, except for "
  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
   e.g.
  </span>
  " which 
  needs a comma before and after it. Only the signal beginning a citation sentence 
  has its initial letter capitalized. The standard clarifying or qualifying words 
  include:
