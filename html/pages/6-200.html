   Principle 1:
  </span>
  While footnote citation is the norm for law journal and treatise writing, citations 
  in memoranda, briefs, and judicial opinions are more commonly integrated with the text
  <span class="example_icon">
   <a href="6-600.htm" target="_blank">
    «e.g.»
   </a>
  </span>
  . Further as more and more readers have taken to viewing these forms of professional writing on electronic devices, many with screens that hold less than a conventional printed page, the comparative utility of having citations immediately adjacent to the text they support has grown.

   Principle 2:
  </span>
  Under most circumstances citations should take the form of citation sentences, 
  beginning with capital letters and ending with periods, directly following the 
  sentence they support or the quotation they identify
  <span class="example_icon">
   <a href="6-600.htm#citation_sentence" target="_blank">
    «e.g.»
   </a>
  </span>
  . 
  When a citation or citations relate to a portion of a sentence they should be 
  embedded in the sentence as a citation clause, set off by commas, directly following 
  that portion
  <span class="example_icon">
   <a href="6-600.htm#internal_cite" target="_blank">
    «e.g.»
   </a>
  </span>

   Principle 3:
  </span>
  Multiple citations whether within a citation sentence or a citation clause are 
  set off from one another with semi-colons
  <span class="example_icon">
   <a href="6-600.htm#string" target="_blank">
    «e.g.»
