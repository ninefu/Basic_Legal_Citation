                    This work first appeared in 1993. It was most recently revised in the fall of 2015 following a thorough review of the actual citation practices of judges and lawyers, the relevant rules of appellate practice of federal and state courts, and the latest edition of The Bluebook, released earlier in the year. As has been true of all editions released since 2010, it is indexed to both the <i>The Bluebook</i> and the <i>ALWD Guide to Legal Citation</i>. However, it also documents the many respects in which contemporary legal writing, very often following guidelines set out in court rules, diverges from the citation formats specified by those academic texts.

                    Since the guide is online, its further revision is not tied to a rigid publication cycle. Any user seeing a need for clarification, correction, or other improvement is encouraged to "speak up." What doesn't work, isn't clear, is missing, appears to be in error? Has a change occurred in one of the fifty states that should be reported? Comments of these and other kinds can sent by email addressed to <a href="mailto:peter.martin@cornell.edu">peter.martin@cornell.edu</a>. (Please include "Citation" in the subject line.) Many of the features and some of the coverage of this reference are the direct result of past user questions and advice.
