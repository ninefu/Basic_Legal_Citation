	</h3>
	<p class="text-level1">When lawyers present legal arguments and
		judges write opinions, they cite authority. They lace their
		representations of what the law is and how it applies to a given
		situation with references to statutes, regulations, and prior
		appellate decisions they believe to be pertinent and supporting. They
		also refer to persuasive secondary literature such as treatises,
		restatements, and journal articles. As a consequence, those who would
		read law writing and do law writing must master a new, technical
		language - "legal citation."</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		For many years, the authoritative reference work on "legal citation"
		was a manual written and published by a small group of law reviews.
		Known by the color of its cover, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			The Bluebook </span> was the codification of professional norms that
		introduced generations of law students to "legal citation." So
		completely do many academics, lawyers, and judges identify the process
		with that book they may refer to putting citations in proper form as
		"Bluebooking" or ask a law student or graduate whether she knows how
		to "Bluebook." The most recent edition of <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook: A Uniform System of
			Citation </span> , the twentieth, was published in 2015. In 2000 a competing
		reference appeared, one designed specifically for instructional use.
		Prepared by the Association of Legal Writing Directors, the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation </span> (5th
		ed. 2014) has won wide acceptance in law school legal writing
		programs.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Differences between the two are microscopic
		(and noted here). In the way that dictionaries both prescribe and
		reflect usage, so do these manuals. Both also reflect their origins.
		They are prepared in law schools with comprehensive print libraries
		and access to the most expensive commercial online legal information
		systems. Their principal focus is on the type of writing that law
		students and law professors do and that academic law journals publish.
		The realities of professional practice in many settings, particularly
		at a time when digital distribution of legal materials has largely
		displaced print, lead to dialects or usages in legal citation neither
		manual includes. And the type of writing required of lawyers and
		judges and the context lead to citation practices quite different from
		those appropriate to published articles.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">This introduction to legal citation is
		focused on the forms of citation used in professional practice rather
		than those used in journal publication. For that reason, it does not
		cover the distinct typography rules for the latter. Furthermore, it
		aims to identify the more important points on which there is
		divergence between the rules set out in the two manuals and evolving
		usage reflected in legal memoranda and briefs prepared by practicing
		lawyers.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		As is true with other languages, learning to read "legal citation" is
		easier than learning to write it fluently. The active use of any
		language requires greater mastery than the receiving and understanding
		of it. In addition, there is the potential confusion of dialects or
		other nonstandard forms of expression. As already noted, "legal
		citation," like other languages, does indeed have dialects. Most are
		readily understandable and thus pose little likelihood of confusion
		for a reader. To the beginning writer, however, they present a serious
		risk of misleading and inconsistent models. As a writer of "legal
		citation," you must take care that you check all references that you
		find in the work of others. This includes citations in court opinions.
		In part this is because commercial publishers have long viewed
		citation as a subtle form of advertising through branding. Thus,
		citations in decisions published in the multiple series of the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> National Reporter System </span> of the
		Thomson Reuters unit known as West (from the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Atlantic Reporter </span> to the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Federal Supplement </span> ) have been
		altered by its editors to refer to other West publications. In
		addition, several important state courts, California, Illinois, and
		New York among them, have idiosyncratic citation norms for their own
		decisions. Many more cite their state's statutes and administrative
		regulations without repetition of a full abbreviation of the state's
		name in each reference, that being implied by context. While each of
		these courts is likely to accept  indeed, may even prefer  briefs
		using the same citation dialect, Federal courts in the same state may
		not. In short, copying and pasting citations from decisions and other
		references into one's own writing is almost certain to yield
		inconsistent, nonstandard, and even incomplete citations.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		Changes in citation norms over time also caution against relying on
		source material for proper citation form. <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> has been revised six
		times since 1990, substantially in 1991, controversially in 1996, and
		again in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 ( <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			see </span> <a href="7-200.html" target="_self"> § 7-200 </a> ). Because of
		these changes, citations you find in legal documents published in
		prior years, although they may have been totally conformed to citation
		standards at the time of writing, may need reformatting to comply with
		current ones. In other words, imported citations, even those imported
		from the most carefully edited pre-2015 journal articles, books, or
		opinions, may not be in proper current form. It should also be noted
		that <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> itself has
		throughout these revisions set forth two distinct versions of citation
		 one for journals and an alternative set of "practitioner rules."
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		What about the feature now part of many online services that enables
		users to block text and copy it together with its “citation” into
		their notes? With some services users are even invited to select among
		a number of different citation formats. Regrettably, even the best
		(and most expensive) do not remove the need for researchers to know
		and apply the detailed citation norms applicable to the brief or
		memorandum they will ultimately prepare. There are several reasons for
		this gap between promise and performance. To begin, the most prominent
		services continue to view citation as a means of branding. Any
		statutory provision retrieved with citation from Westlaw or Lexis will
		cite to the publisher’s proprietary version of the jurisdiction’s code
		rather than provide the reference in its official or generic format.
		Case citations retrieved from Westlaw give unnecessary prominence to
		the publisher’s <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> National
			Reporter System </span> volume and page numbers. Secondly, none of the
		services delivers all the information that a writer will need for a
		complete citation across all types of material. Many fail to include
		the page or paragraph number of a specific passage copied from within
		a case. All fail to include the subsection, paragraph, and
		subparagraph numbers of a copied statutory or regulatory provision.
		What this means is that before you can safely rely on citations
		delivered by an online service you must have mastered legal citation
		sufficiently to know what additional information you will need to
		append to them manually in your notes, what portion of the citations
		furnished you can safely delete, and the extent to which you will need
		to reformat what remains.

	<p class="text-level1">
		Few people find a dictionary the best starting point for learning a
		new language. For many of the same reasons neither <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> nor the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation </span> is a
		good primer. Like dictionaries, both manuals are designed as
		comprehensive reference works. This introduction refers to them
		throughout. But while they aim at exhaustive coverage, these materials
		seek to introduce the basics through concise statements of principles
		and usage linked to examples. The aim is not to separate you from a
		full reference work; inevitably you will encounter unusual situations
		that require "looking up" the proper "rule" or abbreviation in a more
		comprehensive manual. Instead, this introduction aims at building a
		basic mastery of "legal citation" as codified in the two major
		references <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> </span>  a level of
		mastery that should enable you to do all of your legal reading and
		much of your legal writing without having to reach for them. Since
		both <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> and the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation </span>
		embrace the full range of journal writing, they furnish guidance on
		how to cite all manner of references infrequently used in practitioner
		writing, including a variety of foreign law materials and historic
		references. By contrast, this introduction is limited to contemporary
		U.S. legal material.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		Because this introduction is not a substitute for a comprehensive
		reference, you would be wise to introduce yourself to one as you
		proceed through this material. Read through its table of contents and
		introductory material. Each topic covered here includes links to
		tables providing references to coverage in <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> and the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal Citation </span> .
		Observing how the manual that you have chosen (or others have chosen
		for you) arrays its more detailed treatment should be part of your
		initial exploration of each topic here.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">There is no question but that striving for
		proper citation form will for a time seem a silly distraction from the
		core project of writing. But as is true with other languages, those
		who use this one carefully make negative assumptions about the craft
		of those who don't. Being a simple language at its core, this one
		should fairly quickly become a matter of habit and, thus, no longer a
		distraction.</p>
