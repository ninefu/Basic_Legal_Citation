     This electronic publication was conceived in the summer of 1992. A small band of Cornell Law students, charged with identifying subjects on which computer-based materials would be particularly helpful, placed citation at the top of the list. With their assistance I prepared the first edition of
     <span>
      <span class="italics">

      </span>
     </span>
     It was released on diskette that fall, one of the first hypertext publications of Cornell's Legal Information Institute (LII). Later reconfigured for the Web, where it still resides at:
     <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/">
      http://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/
     </a>
     , the work has been updated regularly in the years since. Like that online version on which it is based, this e-book was most recently revised in the fall of 2015. It is indexed to the fifth edition of the

       The Bluebook
      </span>
     </span>
     . But it also rests firmly on the steadily evolving practice of judges writing opinions and lawyers writing briefs.

     This is not a comprehensive citation reference work. Its limited aim is to serve as a tutorial on how to cite the most widely referenced types of U.S. legal material, taking account of local norms and the changes in citation practice forced by the shift from print to electronic sources. It begins with an introductory unit. That is followed immediately by one on "how to cite" the categories of authority that comprise a majority of the citations in briefs and legal memoranda. Using the full table of contents one can proceed through this material in sequence. The third unit, organized around illustrative examples, is intended to be used either for review and reinforcement of the prior "how to" sections or as an alternative approach to them. One can start with it since the illustrative examples for each document type are linked back to the relevant "how to" principles.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="">
     The sections on abbreviations and omissions, on typeface (italics and underlining), and on how citations fit into the larger project of legal writing that follow all support the preceding units. They are accessible independently and also, where appropriate, via links from the earlier sections. Finally, there are a series of cross reference tables tying this introduction to the two major legal citation reference works and to state-specific citation rules and practices.

    <span class="">
     The work is also designed to be used by those confronting a specific citation issue. For such purposes the table of contents provides one path to the relevant material. Another path, to which the bar at the top of each major section provides ready access, is a topical index. This index is alphabetically arrayed and more detailed than the table of contents. Finally, the search function in your e-book reader software should allow an even narrower inquiry, such as one seeking the abbreviation for a specific word (
     <span>
      <span class="italics">
       e.g.
      </span>

     , institute) or illustrative citations for a particular state, Ohio, say.
