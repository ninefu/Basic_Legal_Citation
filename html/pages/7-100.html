		The principles and practices described in this <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Introduction to Basic Legal
			Citation </span> are elaborated in far greater specificity (and with
		differences noted throughout this work) in two citation references
		widely used in U.S. law schools.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		This concluding segment contains a set of point by point
		cross-references to those books. Tables set out in subsequent sections
		have been designed to enable users of this introduction to find the
		relevant treatment of each citation principle or category of material
		covered here in either <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The
			Bluebook </span> ( <a href="7-300.html" target="_self"> § 7-300 </a> ) or
		the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to Legal
			Citation </span> ( <a href="7-400.html" target="_self"> § 7-400 </a> ),
		whichever they are working from.
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		In addition, because the current <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			Bluebook </span> is but the latest in a long succession of editions, it
		being the twentieth, this segment offers an inventory of the more
		recent changes of significance. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">

	<p class="text-level1">
		A concluding table ( <a href="7-500.html" target="_self"> § 7-500
		</a> ) furnishes state by state access to citation examples of the three
		most frequently cited categories of primary law material – cases,
		statutes, and regulations – noting those points on which the norms and
		practice of each state diverge from the prescriptions of the
		"national" guides.
