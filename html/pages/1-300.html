		ยง 1-300. <a name="1-300"> </a> Types of Citation Principles
	</h3>
	<p class="text-level1">The detailed principles of citation can be
		conceived of as falling into four categories:
	<ul class="ebook-nobullet">
		<li class="text-level2"><b> Core Identification Principles </b> :
			Principles that specify the minimum elements necessary to identify a
			cited document or document portion in terms that will allow the
			reader to retrieve it.</li>
		<li class="text-level2"><b> Other Minimum Content Principles
		</b> : Principles that call for the inclusion in a citation of additional
			information items beyond a retrieval formula ย the full name of the
			author of a journal article, the year a decision was rendered or a
			book, published. Some of these principles are conditional, that is,
			they require the inclusion of a particular item under specified
			circumstances so that the absence of that item from a citation
			represents that those circumstances do not exist. The subsequent
			history of a case must be indicated when it exists, for example; the
			edition of a book must be indicated if there have been more than one.
			Most of these additional items either furnish a "name" for the cited
			document or information that will allow the reader to evaluate its
			importance.</li>
		<li class="text-level2"><b> Compacting Principles </b> :
			Principles that reduce the space taken up by the information items
			included in a citation. These include standard abbreviations ("United
			States Code" becomes "U.S.C.") and principles that eliminate
			redundancy. (If the deciding court is communicated by the name of the
			reporter, it need not be repeated in the citation's concluding
			parentheses along with the date as it should otherwise be.)</li>
		<li class="text-level2"><b> Format Principles </b> : Principles
			about punctuation, typography, order of items within a citation, and
			the like. Such principles apply to the optional elements in a
			citation as well as the mandatory ones. One need not report to the
			reader that a cited Supreme Court case was decided 5-4; but if one
			does, there is a standard form.</li>
	</ul>
