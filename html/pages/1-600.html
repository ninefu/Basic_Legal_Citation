		§ 1-600. <a name="1-600"> </a> Who Sets Citation Norms
	</h3>
	<p class="text-level1">There is no national citation
		standard-setting authority, and despite the tendency of citation
		manuals to attach the word "rule" to specific citation practices,
		their authoritative reach is, at best, limited to a specific sector 
		those writing for particular journals, editing material for one or
		another commercial publisher, submitting briefs to a particular court.
		For most law writing, the relevant citations norms are set by widely
		accepted professional usage.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		The citation manual created by the editors of four law journals, the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Columbia Law Review </span> , the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Harvard Law Review </span> , the <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> University of Pennsylvania Law
			Review </span> , and <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Yale Law
			Journal </span> , invariably referred to as <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			The Bluebook </span> , was for decades the most widely used codification of
		national citation norms. Now in its twentieth edition, <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The Bluebook </span> governs the citation
		practices of the majority of U.S. student-edited law journals and has,
		through its successive editions, shaped the citation education and
		resulting citation habits of most U.S. lawyers.

	<p class="text-level1">
		The much newer <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> ALWD Guide to
			Legal Citation </span> (5th ed. 2014) has gained a wide following in U.S.
		law schools, and since it aims to reflect current usage. Its current
		edition is highly consistent with <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			The Bluebook </span> .
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		An earlier competing academic project, <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> The University of Chicago Manual
			of Legal Citation </span> , which called itself the "Maroon Book," offered a
		distinctly different and less rigid set of rules. First published in
		1989, it failed to win a significant following or affect professional
		practice except insofar as it recognized the importance of leaving "a
		fair amount of discretion to practitioners, authors, and editors." <span

	<p class="text-level1">In some states, the norms set out in
		national manuals are supplemented or overridden by court rules about
		the content, composition, and format of legal memoranda and briefs.
		Most often such rules are largely consistent with national norms but
		set out special and typically more detailed rules for the citation of
		cases, statutes, and regulations of the state in question. Some of
		these state-specific rules call for inclusion of an additional
		citation element, such as a medium-neutral or other official case
		citation. Others require less, as, for example, not calling for
		repetition of the state name or its abbreviation in all state
		statutory citations, that being supplied by implication. Only a
		handful of these court rules set out a markedly different citation
		format. While court-mandated citation rules of this sort formally
		apply only to documents filed with the specified courts, they are
		likely to influence professional citation practice within the state
		more generally.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Courts not only shape local citation norms
		by their rules governing brief format, their policies for publication
		and dissemination affect the means of citation. Only a court can
		effectively establish the means for vendor- and medium-neutral
		citation of its decisions. Courts that leave the association of an
		enduring, citable identification for each decision and its parts to a
		commercial publisher, by default, force the use of the dominant
		publisher's print citation scheme.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">Some courts, including both the Supreme
		Court and court systems in a number of states, retain full editorial
		responsibility for citable, final and official versions of their
		opinions. Generally implemented through a public court reporter's
		office, this function invariably gives rise to detailed citation
		norms, as well as other rules of style, that apply to decisions
		distributed by the court. Where the court's citation format is
		significantly different from national norms, as it is, for example, in
		New York, that may or may not influence lawyer citation practice.
		Courts seriously implementing medium-neutral citation not only attach
		the necessary decision ID and paragraph numbering to each decision,
		but use it in citing prior cases.</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		The large commercial publishers also have their own distinct citation
		practices, in part designed to reinforce brand. A judge's citation to
		" <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Butner </span> v. <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> United States </span> , 440 U.S. 48, 55
		(1979)" when reported in West's <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			National Reporter System </span> becomes " <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			Butner v. United States </span> , 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d
		136 (1979)." Annotations and summaries in the LexisNexis <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> Lawyers' Edition </span> of Supreme Court
		decisions cite to the same publisher's <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> United States Code Service </span>  <span
			class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> e.g. </span> , "15 U.S.C.S. § 637(d)."
	</p>
	<p class="text-level1">
		As noted in the discussion of medium-neutral citation, two important
		national bodies, the American Bar Association (ABA) and American
		Association of Law Libraries (AALL), have sought to persuade courts,
		publishers, and lawyers to implement citation standards that are not
		keyed to print or to any specific publisher's offerings. The AALL has
		gone further and published a <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
			Universal Citation Guide </span> . This guide sets out a blueprint for
		courts designing medium-neutral citation schemes for their own
		decisions, as well as complementary approaches to other types of legal
		authority that can be implemented simply through professional
		acceptance. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"> See </span> <a

	<p class="text-level1">In the end, most of "legal citation," like
		most of any language, is established by constantly evolving usage,
		reinforced in some cases, altered in others, by the members of
		distinct communities.</p>
