<H1>by Peter W. Martin</H1>

<P>   This hypertext reference is designed to introduce legal citation to the beginner and to serve as a reference on basic citation points for more experienced writers and citation checkers.
<P>   The version distributed in this form is a small subset of the FOLIO version available from the Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School.
<P>   In this version the section symbol is represented with the abbreviation "sect." and underlining is indicated by a preceding and following underbar (e.g., _underlined text_).

<P>        CASE CITATIONS -- MOST COMMON FORM
<P>    The core of a case citation consists of: 
<P>     = the parties' names
<P>       -boiled down using _The Bluebook_'s standard omissions
<P>       -and abbreviations
<P>         -names are underlined
<P>         -a lower case "v." replaces "versus"
<P>         -names are followed by a comma
<P>     = an address for the case consisting of:
<P>       -reporter volume number
<P>       -reporter name (abbreviated)
<P>       -the first page of the case in that volume
<P>         -if the reference is to a portion of the opinion, the page or pages of that part will follow the first page, set off by a comma
<P>     = in most situations only one address is required, in a single preferred reporter
<P>         -with state cases _cited to a court in the same state_ parallel addresses should be provided when the case is reported in both an official reporter and a West regional reporter -- the official reporter address coming first, the regional reporter address second, the two separated by a comma
<P>         -under other circumstances state decisions that appear in a regional reporter are cited only to that reporter
<P>         -this means that the same decision will have a different citation form when cited within its state than when cited in other states
<P>     = the date
<P>         -year of decision is enclosed in parentheses
<P>     = the court
<P>         -in any reference where the court is identified by the reporter, as for example "U.S.", no additional reference is necessary
<P>         -the regional reporters covering numerous states and the reporters containing decisions of the lower federal courts do not sufficiently identify the court for a particular case and so that information must be added
<P>           -court identification is placed, in abbreviated form in the parentheses containing the year of decision
<P>             -the highest appellate court in a state is indicated by the abbreviation for the state standing alone (no notation at all is required when the state is indicated in a reporter name); for example, "(Kan. 1976)" indicates a 1976 decision of the Kansas Supreme Court while a decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals would be indicated by "(Kan. Ct. App. 1984)" and a decision of the Kansas Supreme Court court cited to the official reporter would simply show the date

<P>        CASE CITATIONS -- CONDITIONAL ITEMS
<P>    The core of a common form case citation includes two items that communicate by their absence.  In other words, a case citation is read with the expectation that _if_ certain things have occurred they will be reported as part of a reference.  Citations that are silent on these subjects are taken as representing that these things have not occurred.
<P>    A citation consisting only of the core items represents that a clear holding of a majority of the court stands for the proposition with which the writer has associated it.  It also represents that there have been no legal proceedings in the case occurring after the cited opinion.  
<P>     = If the citation is to a dissenting opinion or to dictum or to a plurality opinion that fact should be reported in separate parentheses following the date
<P>     = If the Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari in a case or any other subsequent reported action was taken, those actions should be reported following the core items 
<P>        CASE CITATIONS -- VARIANTS AND SPECIAL CASES
<P>   Most case citations refer to opinions that have appeared in print in standard reporters.  Opinions for which that is not true either because they are very recent or for some other reason call for more specialized identification.  The challenge in such a situation is to furnish the reader sufficient information to retrieve the document.  The following alternatives to a print reporter citation can be used.  They are listed in order of preference.
<P>     = With cases available in a print looseleaf service, the minimum address (following the case name) consists of: 
<P>         -a full service citation
<P>         -court
<P>         -full date
<P><A HREF=examples.html#case_examples-slip_opinions>Examples:</A>
<P>     = With cases available on LEXIS or WESTLAW but not yet in print, the minimum address (following the case name) consists of: 
<P>         -docket number
<P>         -online citation
<P>         -court (to the extent not communicated by the online citation)
<P>         -full date
<P><A HREF=examples.html#case_examples-online>Examples:</A>
<P>     = With cases available only from the court in slip opinion, the minimum address (following the case name) consists of:
<P>         -docket number
<P>         -court
<P>         -full date

<P><A NAME=how_to_cite_constitutions and statutes><H4>HOW TO CITE CONSTITUTIONS AND STATUTES</H4></A>
<P>        CONSTITUTION CITATION -- MOST COMMON FORM
<P>   A constitution citation consists of two parts:
<P>     = the name of the constitution
<P>         -the name consists of the abbreviation of the jurisdiction (e.g., U.S. for United States, N.Y. for New York) and "Const."
<P>     = the cited part
<P>         -parts often include articles (abbreviated "art.") and amendments (abbreviated "amend."), in addition to sections (sect.)
<P>   No punctuation separates the name of the constitution from the first part identifier; commas separate successive subparts
<P>   Nothing is underlined
<P><A HREF=examples.html#constitution_examples>Examples:</A>
<P>        STATUTE CITATION -- MOST COMMON FORM
<P>   Federal Statutes
<P>   The full address of a federal statute consists of:
<P>     = title number
<P>     = name of code (abbreviated -- U.S.C., U.S.C.A. or U.S.C.S.) followed by the section number (a space separates the section symbol (sect.) from the number)
<P>     = year the code volume was published, in parentheses
<P><A HREF=examples.html#statute_examples-federal>Examples:</A>
<P>   Conditional items:
<P>     = If possible the reference should be to U.S.C., the official codification.  If one of the unofficial codifications is cited, the publisher's name (abbreviated) should be placed ahead of the year in the parentheses.
<P>   State Statutes
<P>   The full address of a codified state statute consists of:
<P>     = the name of code
<P>     = the number of the section or part, using the division identifiers of the particular code
<P>         -In some states major divisions of the code are designated by name rather than number
<P>     = the year the code volume was published, in parentheses
<P>   Conditional items:
<P>     = If possible the reference should be to the official codification.  If one of the unofficial codifications is cited, the publisher's name (abbreviated) should be placed ahead of the year in the parentheses.
<P>Examples:
<P>   Further Conditional Items -- Pocket Parts and Supplements
<P>   The reader of a statutory citation will expect that it refers to the statute as currently in force unless the reference says otherwise.  If the statute appears in a volume published in 1988 and your research (which will include a check of any subsequent supplements or pocket parts) indicates the statute has not been amended, the year in parentheses will be 1988.  Only if the statute has been amended since 1988 should the citation refer to the supplement.  If the part of the statute to which you refer, as amended, appears in the supplement the parenthetical should read (Supp. 1992).  If the reader must read the supplement or pocket part together with the principal volume for the full text of your reference the parenthetical should read (1988 & Supp. 1992).
<P><A HREF=examples.html#statute_examples-federal_supplement>Examples:</A>
<P>        STATUTE CITATIONS -- VARIANTS AND SPECIAL CASES
<P>    Session Laws
<P>    Don't cite a statute to the session laws (the compiled enactments of a legislative body during a particular session) if a codified version will serve your purposes.  That principle confines session law citations to: very recent enactments (provisions not yet published even in supplement or pocket part of the relevant code), situations where the reference is to enactment or to provisions of a law that have since been repealed or modified, enactments that are so scattered across the code that a reference to the session laws is more efficient, and finally those rare cases in which the language in the codified version differs in some significant way from the session laws.  For federal statutes, a session law reference consists of: the name of the statute, its public law number ("Pub. L. No."), a volume number followed by "Stat." and a page number, followed by the year of enactment in parentheses. 
<P><A HREF=examples.html#statute_examples-federal_session_laws>Examples:</A>
<P>    Bills
<P>    Bills are cited either when they support a point about the legislative history of an enactment or when they have not been enacted.
<P><A HREF=examples.html#statute_examples-federal_bills>Examples:</A>
<P>    Named Statutes, Original Section Numbers
<P>    Some statutes are commonly referred to by name, and in some of these cases, section references within the original legislation are still widely used.  Such references should never substitute for a core reference to the legislation as codified, but they can be added to it.
<P><A HREF=examples.html#statute_examples-federal_named_act>Examples:</A>
<P>    Internal Revenue Code
<P>    An important exception to the general norms for citation of federal statutes allows (but does not require) references to the Internal Revenue Code to be in the form:  I.R.C. sect. ___.  This is a substitute for 26 U.S.C. sect. ___ (1988).
<P><A HREF=examples.html#statute_examples-federal_i.r.c.>Examples:</A>
<P>    Uniform Acts
<P>    When a uniform act has been adopted by a state and is being referred to as the law of that state it is cited like any other state law.  When a reference is to the uniform law itself, the citation should consist of name of the uniform law (as abbreviated), section number, and year of publication.  A citation to the Uniform Laws Annotated (U.L.A.) may be included but is not required.

<P><A NAME=how_to_cite_regulations><H4>HOW TO CITE REGULATIONS</H4></A>
<P>        REGULATION CITATIONS -- MOST COMMON FORM
<P>    Federal Regulations
<P>    Like statutes, agency regulations are cited to codifications if possible.  With federal regulations this means citing to the _Code of Federal Regulations_ (C.F.R.).  
<P>    A full federal regulation citation consists of:
<P>     = volume number
<P>     = "C.F.R."
<P>     = section number
<P>     = year of publication of the most recent edition of that volume (in parentheses)
<P><A HREF=examples.html#regulation_examples-federal_c.f.r.>Examples:</A>
<P>    State Regulations
<P>    A full state regulation citation consists of equivalent components, adjusted to the nomenclature of the particular codification.
<P><A HREF=examples.html#regulation_examples-state>Examples:</A>
<P>        REGULATION CITATIONS -- VARIANTS AND SPECIAL CASES
<P>   Federal regulations not yet codified or citations to a regulation as originally promulgated are cited to the _Federal Register_ (Fed. Reg.).  
<P><A HREF=examples.html#regulation_examples-federal_register>Examples:</A>
<P>   State regulations not yet codified or citations to regulations as originally promulgated are cited to an equivalent publication if one exists.
