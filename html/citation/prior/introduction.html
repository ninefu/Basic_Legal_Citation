<P>   This hypertext reference is designed to introduce legal citation to the beginner and to serve as a reference on basic citation points for more experienced writers and citation checkers.
<P>   The version distributed in this form is a small subset of the FOLIO version available from the Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School.
<P>   In this version the section symbol is represented with the abbreviation "sect." and underlining is indicated by a preceding and following underbar (e.g., _underlined text_).

<P><A NAME=learning_legal_citation><H4>LEARNING LEGAL CITATION</H4></A>
<P>    When lawyers present legal arguments and judges write opinions they cite authority.  They lace their representations of what the law is with references to the statutes, regulations, and prior appellate decisions they believe to be pertinent and supporting.  They also refer to persuasive secondary literature such as treatises, restatements, and journal articles.  As a consequence those who would read law writing and do law writing must master a new, technical language -- "legal citation".
<P>    The authoritative reference work on "legal citation" is _The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation_ (15th ed. 1991).  _The Bluebook_ not only establishes the citation norms for most law journal writing but lays out those that most courts expect lawyers to follow in briefs and memoranda.  The principal difference between _The Bluebook_'s rules for lawyers and its rules for journal writers has to do with typeface conventions.  Being a publication of a group of law journals, _The Bluebook_ presents nearly all rules in their journal form, requiring those consulting it to use a section called Practitioners' Notes (pp. 11-19) and a reference table inside the back cover to convert those rules to brief or memorandum form.
<P>    Like other new languages, "legal citation" is easier to read than write, at least at first.  The active use of any language  requires greater mastery than the receiving and understanding of it.  In addition there is the potential confusion of dialects or non-standard forms of expression.  Like other languages "legal citation" has dialects.  Most are readily translatable and so to the reader they are unlikely to cause confusion.  However, to the beginning writer they pose a serious risk of misleading models.  As a writer of "legal citation" you must take care that you check all references that you find in the work of others.  Do not assume that a citation that you find in another's work is in proper form or even accurate.  That is especially true of  citations that are not recent.  _The Bluebook_ was substantially revised in 1991.  Consequently, citations you find in legal documents published in 1991 or earlier although totally conformed to a prior edition of _The Bluebook_ may, in important respects, need reformatting to comply with the standards contained in the fifteenth edition.
<P>    Few people find a dictionary the best starting point for learning a new language.  As an introduction to the reading and writing of legal citations, _The Bluebook_ often suffers the same limitations.  _The Bluebook_ is a critical reference work.  These materials refer to it throughout.  But while _The Bluebook_ aims at comprehensive coverage, these materials seek to introduce the basics through concise rule summaries linked to numerous examples.  The aim is not to separate you from _The Bluebook_; inevitably you will encounter unusual situations that require "looking up" the proper rule or abbreviation in its pages.  Instead, this introduction aims at building a basic mastery of "legal citation" as codified in _The Bluebook_ -- a level of mastery that will allow you to do all of your legal reading and the bulk of your legal writing without having to reach for it.  While _The Bluebook_ furnishes guidance on the citation of all sorts of references little used in practitioner writing, including a variety of foreign law materials and historic references, this introduction is limited to contemporary U.S. legal material.
<P>    Since this introduction does not substitute for _The Bluebook_ you should introduce yourself to _The Bluebook_ as you are introduced to legal citation.  Read through its table of contents and the introductory material on pp. 3-9.  Glance over the Practitioners' Notes (pp. 11-19).  Each topic covered in this introduction includes references to _The Bluebook_.  It would be wise to look at how _The Bluebook_ arrays its more detailed treatment of the topic as part of your introduction to it.
<P>    There is no question but that striving for proper citation form will for a time seem a silly distraction.  But as with other languages, those who use this one carefully make negative assumptions about the craft of those who don't.  Being a simple language at its core, this one should fairly quickly become a matter of habit and, thus, no longer a distraction.
<P><A NAME=purposes_of_legal_citation><H4>PURPOSES OF LEGAL CITATION</H4></A>
<P>    What is "legal citation"?  It is a standard language that allows one lawyer to refer to legal authorities with sufficient precision and generality that other lawyers or judges can follow  the references.  Because writing by lawyers and judges is so dependent on such references, it is a language of abbreviations and special terms.  This encryption creates difficulty for lay readers, but produces a dramatic reduction in the space consumed by references.  As you become an experienced reader of law writing you will learn to follow a line of argument straight through the many citations that lace it.  Even so citations are a distraction until the reader wishes to follow one.  The fundamental trade-off that underlies any citation scheme is a trade-off between providing full information about the referenced work and keeping the text as uncluttered as possible.  Standard abbreviations and codes help achieve a reasonable compromise of these competing interests.
<P>    A reference properly written in "legal citation" strives to do at least three things, in limited space:
<P>     = to identify the document or document part to which the author is referring
<P>     = to provide the reader with sufficient information to find the document or document part in the sources the _reader_ has available (which may or may not be the same sources as those used by the writer)
<P>     = to furnish important additional information about the referenced material and its connection to the writer's argument that a reader trying to decide whether or not to pursue the reference would want to know.
<P>    Consider as an illustration of the problem faced and trade-off struck by "legal citation" the 1989 decision of the Supreme Court on an important copyright case.  There are countless sources of the full text opinion.  One is LEXIS, where the following appears.  If a lawyer, wanting to refer to all or part of that opinion, were to include all the indentifying material shown in LEXIS in her brief (with a similar amount of identifying material for other authorities) there would be scarce room for anything else and the reader would have an impossible time following lines of argument past the massive interruptions of citation.

<P>PRIOR HISTORY: CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.                                            
<P>DISPOSITION: 270 U. S. App. D. C. 26, 846 F.2d 1485, affirmed.
<P>================================================================
<P>In "legal citation" the reference to this opinion becomes simply:
<P>_Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid_, 490 U.S. 730 (1989).  With economy this identifies the document and allows another lawyer to retrieve the decision from a wide range of print and electronic sources.  The "address" of "490 U.S. 730" suffices for a reader who has access to the Supreme Court Reporter published by West or to the Lawyers Edition, Second Series published by Lawyers Coop or WESTLAW.  It tells the reader that this is a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court (and not, in contrast, a twenty year old opinion of a U.S. District Court).  
<P>    The task of "legal citation" in short is to provide sufficient information to the reader of a brief or memorandum to aid a decision about which authorities to check and in what order to check them as well as to permit retrieval -- all of that, without consuming any more space or creating any more distraction than is absolutely necessary.
<P><A NAME=types_of_citation_rules><H4>TYPES OF CITATION RULES</H4></A>
<P>   The rules of citation can be conceived of as falling in four categories:
<P>     = Full Address Rules: Rules that specify completeness of the address or identification of a cited document in terms that will allow the reader to retrieve it.
<P>     = Other Minimum Content Rules: Rules that require the inclusion in a citation of additional information items beyond a retrieval address -- the full name of the author of a journal article, the year a decision was rendered or a statutory codification, published.  Some of these rules are conditional, that is, they require the inclusion of a particular item under specified circumstances so that its absence from a citation represents that those circumstances do not exist.  The subsequent history of a case must be indicated when it exists, for example; the edition of a book must be indicated only when there have been more than one.  Most of these additional items either furnish a "name" for the cited document or information that will allow the reader to evaluate its importance.
<P>     = Compaction Rules: Rules that reduce the space taken up by the information items included in a citation.  These include standard abbreviations ("United States Code" becomes "U.S.C.") and rules that eliminate redundancy (if the deciding court is communicated by the name of the reporter it should not be repeated in the parentheses with the date).
<P>     = Format Rules: Rules about punctuation and underlining and order of items within a citation fall in this category.  These rules apply to the optional elements in a citation as well as the mandatory ones.  One need not report to the reader that a cited Supreme Court case was decided 5-4, but if one does, there is a proper form.
<P><A NAME=levels_of_mastery><H4>LEVELS OF MASTERY</H4></A>
<P>    What degree of mastery of this language should one strive for -- as a law student or lawyer?
<P>    Recall that a citation serves several purposes.  Of those purposes one is paramount -- furnishing accurate information that will allow retrieval of the cited document or document part.  The part of citation that calls for immediate mastery is painstaking care in recording and presenting the complete address of a document.  Citing a case using the wrong volume or page number, citing a statute with an erroneous section number or without a necessary title number -- errors like these cannot be explained away by the intricacies of _The Bluebook_; all are grevious errors.  Since in many cases part of the clear address to a cited document includes an abbreviation, a small set of abbreviations must be mastered as soon as possible.  A minimum set includes those that represent the reporters for contemporary federal decisions, those that represent codified federal statutes and regulations, and those that represent the regional reporters of state decisions.  Whenever your research is centered in the law of a particular state you will want to memorize as well the abbreviations that represent the reporters, statutory compilations, and regulations of that state.
<P>    Less critical in terms of function but no more difficult to master are the abbreviations that indicate the deciding court when that information is not implicit in the name of the reporter.  You should strive to master the abbreviations for the circuits of the U.S. Courts of Appeals and those for the U.S. District Courts.  Any time your research is centered in the law of a particular state you will want to master the abbreviations for its courts.
<P>    Last and least are the conventions for reducing the space consumed by case names.  Including the full word "Environmental" in a case name rather than _The Bluebook_ prescribed abbreviation "Envtl." standing by itself is a trivial oversight.  A consistent failure to abbreviate on the one hand or the use of idiosyncratic abbreviations on the other can produce inconvenience for the reader.  Since your aim in nearly all law writing will be to persuade your reader, to win your reader over, you do not want to irritate your reader or to convey an impression of carelessness.  Therefore, a final review of one's citations against _The Bluebook_'s standard abbreviations and omissions is an important step.  In time, you should find that you have mastered most of those rules.
<P>    Writing legal citation follows thorough legal research.  As you carry out your research your notes should capture all the information you will need to write the necessary citations.  That means recording all the required items for a full citation.  It doesn't mean that you should take the time to check proper abbreviations; that can be a later step.  What you will want to achieve as soon as possible is the command of what information elements will be required in a citation so that you do not have to pay return visits to sources simply to determine which circuit decided the case or whether the statutory section to which you refer is in the main volume or the pocket part.
<P>    Mastery of reading legal citation should be a first goal.  Since you are surrounded by citations in your law school classes that should be easy.  But it does require an active frame of mind.  As you read assignments in your casebooks exercise your growing command of legal citation by asking yourself occasionally about a cited source: What is it?  How would I retrieve it?  And when you are reading in a location where you have access to cases, statutes or other cited material and your head needs a change of pace, follow a citation or two.  Reading citations should not require use of _The Bluebook_.
<P>    Ultimately you will be able to write most citations without use of _The Bluebook_ or this reference -- most but not all.  The old and the unusual will drive the most experienced lawyer back to the pages of _The Bluebook_.
