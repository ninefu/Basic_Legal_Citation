<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Great Wolf Lodge of Traverse City, LLC v. PSC</span>, 489 Mich. 27, 799 N.W.2d 155 (2011)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">A court reviewing an administrative agency's interpretation of a statute should give the agency's interpretation "respectful consideration" and, if it is persuasive, should not overrule it without "cogent reasons." <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">In re Complaint of Rovas Against SBC Mich.</span>, 482 Mich. 90, 108, 754 N.W.2d 259 (2008)</span>. We have held that "[i]n construing administrative rules, courts apply principles of statutory construction." <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Detroit Base Coalition for Human Rights of the Handicapped v. Dep't of Social Servs.</span>, 431 Mich. 172, 185, 428 N.W.2d 335 (1988)</span>, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">citing</span>    <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Gen. Motors Corp. v. Bureau of Safety & Regulation</span>, 133 Mich. App. 284, 349 N.W.2d 157 (1984)</span>.  All rates, fares, charges, classification and joint rates, regulations, practices, and services prescribed by the PSC are presumed, prima facie, to be lawful and reasonable. <span class="highlight">MCL 462.25</span>; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">see also</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Mich. Consol. Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm.</span>, 389 Mich. 624, 635-636, 209 N.W.2d 210 (1973)</span>.</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The Court of Appeals reasoned that <span class="highlight">MCL 460.558</span> does not apply solely in cases of "wilful or knowing failure to comply with a lawful PSC order; it also applies in the event of negligent noncompliance." We disagree. Under the Court of Appeals' construction, <span class="highlight">MCL 460.558</span> would require that a fine be imposed any time a utility or its agent fails to comply with a PSC order. If that construction were what the Legislature intended in enacting <span class="highlight">MCL 460.558</span>, there would have been no need to include the modifiers "wilfully or knowingly." Rather, the Legislature could simply have mandated a fine in cases in which a party "fails or neglects" to obey a PSC order.</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">We hold that a utility's right of first entitlement under <span class="highlight">Mich Admin Code, R 460.3411(11)</span> entails the right to serve the entire premises. That right is not extinguished when there is a new customer, i.e., new "buildings and facilities served," on the premises. We also hold that, absent a statutory mandate to do so, the PSC need not impose interest when it awards a refund to a party. Finally, we hold that the PSC is required to impose a fine pursuant <span class="highlight">MCL 460.558</span>  only when a utility willfully or knowingly neglects to comply with its order. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the PSC.</p>

<p class="text-level1">3. Point or &quot;jump&quot; citation.</p>

<p class="text-level1">4. Case names.</p>
<p class="text-level2">a. <em>Italicizing</em>. Names of cases should be italicized both in the text of an opinion and in footnotes. Underscoring no longer should be used to indicate italics.</p>

Do not show <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">et al.</span>, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">et ux.</span>, or like references to other parties in a case name, but do show <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">ex rel</span> (for on the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Relation of</span> or <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">for the use and benefit of</span>) and the relator's name.</p>
