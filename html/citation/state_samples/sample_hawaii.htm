  v. Kotis</span>, 91 Haw. 319, 984 P.2d 78 (1999)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">On September 10, 1992, Kotis was indicted for (1) murder 

  in the second degree, in violation of <span class="highlight">Hawai'i Revised 

  Statutes (HRS) &#167; 707-701.5(1) (1993)</span>, (2) kidnapping, in violation of 

  <span class="highlight">HRS &#167; 707-720(1)(e) (1993)</span>, and (3) terroristic 

  threatening in the first degree, in violation of <span class="highlight">HRS 

  &#167; 707-716(1)(d) (1993)</span>. The charges arose from an incident that occurred 

  on or about September 7, 1992, in which Kotis allegedly threatened his wife, 

  Lynne Kotis, and her companion, Gregory Wittman, with a knife, restrained Lynne 

  with intent to terrorize her, and caused Lynne's death while in possession of 

  a firearm. </p>

  334E-2</span>. That rule provides in relevant part . . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Because Kotis was involuntarily hospitalized by order of 

  the circuit court, HAR &#167; 11-175-45(b)(3) applies to his case and authorizes 

  the director's motion for an order of involuntary medication. Administrative 

  rules, like statutes, have the force and effect of law. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">State
