  Found. v. Neb. Dep't of Soc. Serv.</span>, 243 Neb. 130, 498 N.W.2d 86 (1993)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The Nebraska Department of Social Services is responsible 

  for the administration of the medicaid program pursuant to <span class="highlight">Neb. 

  Rev. Stat. &#167; 68-1018 et seq. (Reissue 1990)</span>. In administering the program, 

  the department reimburses medicaid-certified nursing home facilities for the 

  cost of care to medicaid-eligible patients. The department determines payment 

  or reimbursement rates for a nursing home based on allowable costs incurred 

  by the facility. Payment for long-term-care services is set forth in <span class="highlight">471 

  Neb. Admin. Code, &#167; 12-011 et seq. (1987)</span>. Rates paid to long-term-care 

  providers must be "reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred 

  by efficiently and economically operated facilities to provide services in conformance 

  with state and federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards." 

  <span class="highlight">471 Neb. Admin. Code &#167; 12-011.02</span>. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level2">Since October 17, 1977, the Nebraska medicaid program has 

  recognized depreciation as an allowable cost. The regulations also provide for 

  the recapture of depreciation upon the sale of a long-term-care facility for 

  a profit. Depreciation in <span class="highlight">471 NAC 12-011.08D</span> 

  refers to real property only. A long term care facility which is sold for a 

  profit and has received NMAP payments for depreciation, shall refund to the 

  Department the lower of - 1. The amount of depreciation allowed and paid by 

  the Department between July 1, 1976, and the time of sale of the property; or 

  2. The product of the ratio of depreciation paid by the Department since July 

  1, 1976, to the total depreciation accumulated by the facility (adjusted to 

  total allowable depreciation under the straight-line method, if any other method 

  has been used) times the difference in the sale price of the property over the 

  book value of the assets sold. . . . </p>

<p class="text-level1"><span class="highlight">471 Neb. Admin. Code &#167; 12-011.08D</span>. 

</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">This court has previously determined that the department's 

  change in its depreciation recapture regulation did not have a retroactive effect 

  and therefore could not violate a provider's right to due process. See <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">H.H.N.H., 

  Inc. v. Department of Soc. Servs.</span>, 234 Neb. 363, 451 N.W.2d 374 (1990)</span>. 

  Bethesda is not entitled to conclude that its depreciation reimbursement was 

  not subject to being recaptured upon the sale of its facilities, and it did 

  not have a constitutionally protected property right in those reimbursements.
