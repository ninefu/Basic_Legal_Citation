  v. Kan. State Bd. of Technical Professions</span>, 271 Kan. 206, 21 P.3d 542 

  (2001)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Michael Schmidt, a licensed engineer, appeals the decision 

  of the Shawnee County District Court affirming an order of the Kansas State 

  Board of Technical Professions (the Board). The Board determined that certain 

  construction drawings prepared by Schmidt constituted the practice of architecture 

  as defined by <span class="highlight">K.S.A. 2000 Supp. 74-7003</span>. The 

  Board further held that Schmidt, unlicensed to practice architecture, was in 

  violation of the regulations pertaining to professional conduct established 

  by <span class="highlight">K.A.R. 66-6-4(e) (1995 Supp.)</span> which regulations 

  prohibit a licensee from affixing a signature, seal, or both, to a plan dealing 

  with a subject matter outside the licensee's field of competence. The Board 

  publicly censured Schmidt because he affixed his engineer's seal to documents 

  dealing with the subject matter of architecture, an area which it held to be 

  outside his field of competence as established by his education, training and 

  licensing. The Board also required that he pay costs of $ 5,000, an amount the 

  Board determined was a portion of the Board's investigative cost, expenses, 

  and attorneys fees in prosecuting the matter, and an amount equal to the statutory 

  limit. </p>

<p class="text-level1">Because the primary issue in this appeal involves the interpretation 
  of statutes and regulations, the rules of statutory construction set forth in

  </strong>251 Kan. 512, 516, 837 P.2d 381(1992)</span>, apply. "'"In order to 
  ascertain the legislative intent, courts are not permitted to consider only 
  a certain isolated part or parts of an act, but are required to consider and

<p class="text-level1">Similarly, when interpreting administrative regulations, 
  the courts generally will defer to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations. 
  The agency's interpretation will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous 
  or inconsistent with the regulation. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Murphy

  to issue regulations which alter the legislative act which is being administered.
