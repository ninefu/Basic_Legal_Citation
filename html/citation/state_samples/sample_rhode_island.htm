<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Cullen 
  v. Town Council of Lincoln</span>, 893 A.2d 239 (R.I. 2006)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">There can be no doubt that the town's ability to adopt 
  ordinances that govern the construction and regulation of a public sewer system 
  is both provided for by law, P.L. 1984, ch. 270, and falls squarely within the 
  municipal police power, see <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Mill 
  Realty Associates v. Crowe</span></span><span class="highlight">, 841 A.2d 668, 
  674 (R.I. 2004)</span> ("maintaining a public water supply and requiring that 
  builders construct extensions to the town's public water system falls squarely 
  within [a municipality's] police power"); <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Munroe 
  v. Town of East Greenwich</span></span><span class="highlight">, 733 A.2d 703, 
  710 (R.I. 1999)</span> ("zoning, land development and subdivision regulations 
  constitute a valid exercise of [a municipality's] police power"). Proper exercise 
  of this police power is accomplished exclusively by enacting municipal ordinances; 
  however, a town council has discretion to impose requirements additional to 
  an ordinance when provided for in the ordinance itself.</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">We think that this case does not warrant excepting petitioners 
  from the ordinary requirement that they make at least one meaningful application 
  to a state agency before seeking a remedy in the courts by pleading futility. 
  First, the council was presented with evidence that DEM might not be so quick 
  to deny petitioners' application. In addition, petitioners' self-serving conclusion 
  that traversing designated wetlands would present as grave a danger as their 
  proposed pump station route is ultimately only meaningless speculation since 
  DEM is the agency vested with the exclusive power to make precisely this determination. 
  See generally <span class="highlight">G.L. 1956 &#167;&#167; 2-1-18 through 2-1-24</span>. 
  Furthermore, while DEM's regulations may require it to deny a particular tie-in 
  route if an alternate is available which does not traverse a designated area, 
  see Rules and Regulations Governing the Administration and Enforcement of the 
  Freshwater Wetlands Act, Department of Environmental Management, <span class="highlight">12 
  Code R.I. Reg. 190-25-9.05(E)(2)(b) (2001)</span>, it is unclear what DEM would 
  do if the pump station route is no longer available due to the council's denial 
  of petitioners' application.</p>
