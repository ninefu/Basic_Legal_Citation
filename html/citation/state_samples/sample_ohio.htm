<p class="text-level1">{&para;2} &quot;Because the final OP &amp; F board decision

  130 Ohio St.3d 62, 2011 Ohio 4677, 955 N.E.2d 963, 28</span>. A clear legal

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">{&para;3} In November 2009, the board of trustees upheld 
  its previous decision denying Kolcinko's application for disability-retirement 
  benefits. Kolcinko claimed entitlement to an award of benefits under <span class="highlight">R.C. 
  742.38(D)(1)</span>, which provides, &quot;A member of the fund who is permanently 
  and totally disabled as the result of the performance of the member's official 
  duties as a member of a police or fire department shall be paid annual disability 
  benefits in accordance with division (A) of section 742.39 of the Revised Code.&quot; 
  &quot;'Totally disabled' means a member of the fund is unable to perform the 
  duties of any gainful occupation for which the member is reasonably fitted by 
  training, experience, and accomplishments,&quot; and &quot;'[p]ermanently disabled' 
  means a condition of disability from which there is no present indication of 
  recovery.&quot; <span class="highlight">R.C. 742.38(D)(1)(a) and (b)</span>.</p>

<p class="text-level1">{&para;7} Under <span class="highlight">R.C. 742.38</span> 
  and <span class="highlight">Ohio Adm.Code 742-3-05</span>, the OP &amp; F board 
  is vested with the exclusive authority to evaluate the weight and credibility 
  of the medical evidence in determining a member's entitlement to disability-retirement 
  benefits. Notwithstanding Dr. Poa's and Dr. Resnick's conclusion that Kolcinko 
  was permanently disabled, they further noted that Dr. Francis McCafferty had 
  observed that Kolcinko complained of &quot;certain patterns or combinations 
  of features that are unusual or atypical in clinical populations but relatively 
  common among individuals feigning mental disorder.&quot; Dr. Poa and Dr. Resnick 
  opined that Kolcinko had a lower whole-person impairment (12 percent) than the 
  15 percent figure determined by Dr. Smarty.</p>
