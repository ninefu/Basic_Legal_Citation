<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State 

  v. Cannon</span>, 147 Wash. 2d 41, 50 P.3d 627 (2002)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Complying with the implied consent statute, <span class="highlight">RCW 

  46.20.308</span>, Trooper Bosman submitted a sworn "Report of Breath/Blood Test 

  for Alcohol" to the Department of Licensing (DOL). The DOL suspended Respondent 

  Cannon's driving privileges for 90 days. She requested a formal adjudicative 

  hearing before the Department. On September 13, 2001 the DOL held an administrative 

  hearing by telephone to determine whether suspension of Respondent Cannon's 

  driving privileges should be upheld. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Respondent Cannon appealed to the Whatcom County Superior 

  Court. On November 26, 2001 the trial court, the Honorable Steven J. Mura, suppressed 

  Respondent's breath test results and reversed her license suspension, holding 

  that the breath test did not meet the state toxicologist's precision and accuracy 

  standards under newly amended <span class="highlight">WAC 448-13-040</span> 

  and <span class="highlight">448-13-060</span>. In reaching that conclusion the 

  trial court stated "<span class="highlight">WAC 448-13-040</span> and <span class="highlight">448-13-060</span> 

  require the proponent of the breath test to prove that the thermometer used 

  in the subject breath test was certified as required by <span class="highlight">WAC 

  448-13-035</span> before the breath test can be considered valid." </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The basic foundational requirements for admission of breath 
  test results were first established in <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State 
  v. Baker</span>, 56 Wn.2d 846, 852, 355 P.2d 806 (1960)</span>. When the BAC 
  Verifier DataMaster replaced the Breathalyzer machine, a similar set of foundational 
  requirements were adopted, ultimately codified in <span class="highlight">chapter 
  448-12 WAC</span>, the precursor to the current WAC regulations in <span class="highlight">chapter 
  448-13 WAC</span>. The new machine, and its supporting protocols, were challenged 
  but approved in <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State 
  v. Ford</span>, 110 Wn.2d 827, 755 P.2d 806 (1988)</span> and <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State 
  v. Straka</span>, 116 Wn.2d 859, 810 P.2d 888 (1991)</span>. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1"><span class="highlight">WAC 448-13-010</span> articulates 
  the reasons for the rules governing breath testing: (1) to inform "the public 
  of the administrative aspects of the state's breath alcohol test program" and 
  (2) to practice those principles accepted in the scientific community. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Walk 
  v. Dep't of Licensing</span>, 95 Wn. App. 653, 657, 976 P.2d 185 (1999)</span>.</p>

<p class="text-level1"><b>Note: </b>While a prior rule more  explicitly requiring that citations in a brief conform to the form used in the  current volumes of the Washington Reports has been rescinded, the style sheet  of the state's Office of Reporter of Decisions, referred to above, continues to  be a useful guide.  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">The 
  Bluebook</span> is largely incorporated by reference, modified by a set of local 
  abbreviations in the Appendix 1 to Rule 14(d), <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/supreme/?fa=atc_supreme.style">http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/supreme/?fa=atc_supreme.style</a>.</p>
<p class="text-level1">A 2004 order of the Washington Supreme Court directs the 
  publisher of Washington appellate decisions to add paragraph numbers to them. 
  Order No. 25700-B-447, <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/supreme/?fa=atc_supreme.paraOrder">http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/supreme/?fa=atc_supreme.paraOrder</a>. 
  The order authorizes but does not require the use of those paragraph numbers 
  for pinpoint citations. &quot;After an opinion is published in the official 
  reports, a pinpoint citation should be made to page numbers in the official 
  reports, to paragraph numbers from the official reports, or to both.&quot; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Id</span>.</p>
