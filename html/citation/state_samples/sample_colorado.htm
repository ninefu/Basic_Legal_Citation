<p class="text-level1">&para;1 Grand Valley Citizens' Alliance, along with Cary Weldon, Ruth Weldon, Wesley Kent, Marcia Kent, and Western Colorado Congress (collectively, (&quot;GVC&quot;) filled a complaint against the Colorado Oil and Gas Conversation Commission and others (the &quot;Commission&quot;) alleging that it was entitled to a hearing on an application for permit to drill (&quot;APD&quot;) pursuant to <span class="highlight">section 34-60-108(7), C.R.S. (2011)</span>, of the Oil and Gas Conservation Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) and   <span class="highlight">section 24-4-105, C.R.S. (2011)</span>, of the Colorado Administrative Procedure Act. The trial court dismissed the complaint opf the ground that GVC had no standing to request a hearing.</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para;2 GVC appealed and the court of appeals reversed. . . . </p>
<p class="text-level1">  . . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para;15 Here, the Commission promulgated a rule stating that any person seeking to drill must file an APD. 2 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 404-1:303.a (as amended 2009). However, only the operator, surface owner, or the relevant local government may request a hearing on an APD under the Commission&rsquo;s rule. 2 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 404-1:503.b.7 (as amended 2009). GVC cannot seek a hearing under the Commission&rsquo;s rule because it is not the operator, surface owner, or relevant local government.</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para;16 This is not to say, however, that GVC cannot participate in the process and voice its concerns. Under Rule 303.m.(1), the director &quot;may withhold approval of any [APD] &hellip; based on information supplied in a written complaint submitted by any party with standing under Rule 522.a.(1).&quot; <span class="highlight">2 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 404-1 (2009)</span>. Rule 522.a.(1) states, in part, that a complaint can be filed by &quot;any other person who may be directly and adversely affected or aggrieved as the result of [an] alleged violation.&quot; <span class="highlight">2 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 404-1 (2009)</span>. Under these rules, GVC&rsquo;s request to intervene was properly treated as a complaint.</p>
<p class="text-level1">&para;17 In this case, the legislature granted the Commission broad authority under section 34-60-106(1)(f) to regulate the permitting process. Here, the Commission has determined, pursuant to its rules, that only a limited number of parties, not including GVC may request a hearing on an APD. We see no grounds for disturbing that determination. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Colorado Ground Water Comm&rsquo;n v. Eagle Peak Farms</span>, 919 P.2d 212, 217 (Colo. 1996)</span> (agency rules are &quot;presumed valid&quot; and any challenging party has &quot;a heavy burden&quot; to establish that the agency violated constitutional or statutory law, exceeded its authority, or lacked a basis in the record).</p>

<p class="text-level1" align="center"><b>PUBLIC DOMAIN CITATION FORMAT FOR COLORADO 
  SUPREME COURT AND COLORADO COURT OF APPEALS CASES </b></p>
<p class="text-level1">Given the increasing amount of legal research 
  being conducted via the internet and other electronic resources and the desire 
  to promote equal access to Colorado's system of justice, this Chief Justice 
  Directive establishes a public domain citation format that will support the 
  use of Colorado case law in both book and electronic formats. </p>
<p class="text-level1"> Legal practitioners and self-represented 
  parties will be permitted-but not required-to use the public domain citation 
  format instead of citing to the <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Pacific Reporter</span>. 
  Irrespective of which citation format is used, a parallel citation to the other 
  format is also not required. </p>
<p class="text-level1"> Beginning January 1, 2012, the Clerk of the 
  Colorado Supreme Court and the Clerk of the Colorado Court of Appeals shall 
  assign to all opinions announced for publication a citation that shall include:</p>
 
<ol>
  <li class="text-level1">The calendar year in which the 
    opinion is announced; </li>
  <li class="text-level1">Followed by the court designator 
    "CO" for published opinions announced by the Colorado Supreme Court, or followed 
    by the court designator "COA" for published opinions announced by the Court 
    of Appeals; and </li>
  <li class="text-level1">Followed by a consecutive Arabic 
    numeral, beginning in each new calendar year with the number "1"; for example: 
    "2012 CO 1" for the first published opinion announced by the Colorado Supreme 
    Court in 2012, and "2012 COA 1" for the first published opinion announced 
    by the Colorado Court of Appeals in 2012.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-level1">This public domain citation shall appear on the title page 
  of each published opinion announced by the Supreme Court and by the Court of 
  Appeals. All publishers of Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals 
  materials are requested to include this public domain citation within the heading 
  of each Colorado opinion they publish on or after January 1, 2012. In addition:</p>
<p class="text-level1"><b>Numbered paragraphs.</b> Beginning with the first paragraph 
  of text, each paragraph in every published opinion shall be numbered consecutively 
  beginning with a &quot;&para;&quot; symbol followed by an Arabic numeral-beginning 
  with the number &quot;1&quot;-flush with the left margin, opposite the first 
  word of the paragraph. Paragraph numbers shall continue consecutively throughout 
  the text of the majority opinion and on through any concurrence or dissent. 
  Footnotes and paragraphs within footnotes shall not be numbered, nor shall markers, 
  captions, headings, or numerated titles that merely divide sections of opinions. 
  Block-indented, single-spaced portions of a paragraph shall not be numbered 
  as a separate paragraph. All publishers of Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado 
  Court of Appeals materials are requested to include these paragraph numbers 
  in each opinion they publish. </p>
<p class="text-level1"><b>Unpublished opinions.</b> Opinions that are not designated 
  for official publication pursuant to C.A.R. 35(f) shall not be assigned a public 
  domain citation.</p>
<p class="text-level1"><b>Modification, revision, or other substantive amendment.</b> 
  In the case of opinions that are modified, revised, or otherwise substantively 
  amended by subsequent order of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, 
  the public domain citation of the modified, revised, or amended opinion shall 
  be the same as the original public domain citation but followed by the letter 
  &quot;M&quot;; for example, &quot;2012 CO 1M&quot; in the case of a modified 
  Colorado Supreme Court opinion, and &quot;2012 COA 1M&quot; in the case of a 
  modified Colorado Court of Appeals opinion. In the event an opinion is modified, 
  revised, or otherwise substantively amended more than once, the public domain 
  citation of any additional modified, revised, or amended opinion shall be the 
  same as the original public domain citation but designated with the letter &quot;M&quot; 
  followed by a hyphen and the appropriate Arabic numeral; for example: &quot;2012 
  CO 1M-2&quot; in the case of a Colorado Supreme Court opinion modified a second 
  time, and &quot;2012 CO 1M-3&quot; in the case of a Colorado Supreme Court opinion 
  modified a third time, and so on.</p>
<p class="text-level1"><b>Withdrawn, vacated, and reissued opinions.</b> In the 
  case of opinions that are withdrawn or vacated by a subsequent order of the 
  Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals, the public domain citation of the 
  withdrawing or vacating order shall be the same as the original public domain 
  citation but followed by the letter &quot;W&quot;; for example, &quot;2012 CO 
  1W&quot; in the case of a withdrawn or vacated Colorado Supreme Court opinion, 
  and &quot;2012 COA 1W&quot; in the case of a withdrawn or vacated Colorado Court 
  of Appeals opinion. In addition, the withdrawn or vacated opinion shall be removed 
  from the electronic database of opinions maintained by the Supreme Court, and 
  all publishers of Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals materials 
  are requested to remove withdrawn or vacated opinions from their electronic 
  databases. An opinion that is reissued in place of a withdrawn or vacated opinion 
  shall be assigned the next consecutive number appropriate to the date on which 
  the reissued opinion is announced.</p>
<p class="text-level1"><b>Examples of proper public domain citation format.</b>

  the Colorado Supreme Court and the Colorado Court of Appeals on or after January
