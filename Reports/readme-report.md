### What needs to be fixed?

1.  **General Styling**
	- Paragraphs are not justified (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	- The cover page has "Feasibility Study" in it, it was supposed to be Report.
	- Fix the date on the cover page
	- Add a space between the title "Table of contents" and the actual TOC
	- the first letter in author is capitalized
	- In 1.2 we have three items 1), 2), 3) in a single line... change that to a proper itemized style. 

2. **Section 1: introduction** - add an intro to the problem and a context to the problem. We need to explain more clearly what's the issue we're trying to address with our system.
	- I find the first sentence very hard to read
	- We're talking about configuration files in section 1, are we going to implement that?
	- Explain the current system more efficiently in subsection 1.2

3. **Section 4: Preliminary Design**
	- Are we still using XHTML or HTML 4?
	- Add information about the interactivity in 4.3?


4. **Section 5: Project Progress**
	- Change the second paragraph in section 2 and add a paragraph for iteration 3. 
	- Explain the pop-ups; add information about the tagging for search (maybe the HTML parser?). 
	- large tables were not implemented yet, and we didn't test the consistency of file generator (calibre)
	- Update the Gantt Table and Gantt Chart
	- The first part of the Gantt Chart has its dates cluttered together - fix that. 
	- Review of what've done since last iteration
