<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Hines 
  v. Dep't of Pub. Aid</span>, 221 Ill. 2d 222, 850 N.E.2d 148 (2006)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Following briefing and a hearing, the circuit court entered 
  a detailed order, recounting the pertinent facts of the case and reviewing the 
  governing law. In the circuit court's view, section 5-13 of the Public Aid Code 
  (<span class="highlight">305 ILCS 5/5-13 (West 2002)</span>) and <span class="highlight">89 
  Ill. Adm. Code &#167; 102.200</span>, an administrative regulation based on that 
  statute, permitted the Department to seek reimbursement from Beverly's estate 
  for the Medicaid payments it had made on Julius' behalf. </p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">Where, as here, the language of a statute is clear and 
  unambiguous, the court must enforce it as written. It may not annex new provisions 
  or substitute different ones, or read into the statute exceptions, limitations, 
  or conditions which the legislature did not express. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">People 
  ex rel. Department of Professional Regulation v. Manos</span></span><span class="highlight">, 
  202 Ill. 2d 563, 568, 782 N.E.2d 237, 270 Ill. Dec. 43 (2002)</span>, quoting 
  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Bronson v. Washington 
  National Insurance Co.</span></span><span class="highlight">, 59 Ill. App. 2d 
  253, 261-62, 207 N.E.2d 172 (1965)</span>. Moreover, as the appellate court 
  correctly observed, it is a basic principle of statutory construction that "'the 
  enumeration of exceptions in a statute is construed as an exclusion of all other 
  exceptions.'" 358 Ill. App. 3d at 232, quoting <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">People 
  ex rel. Sherman v. Cryns</span></span><span class="highlight">, 203 Ill. 2d 
  264, 286, 786 N.E.2d 139, 271 Ill. Dec. 881 (2003)</span>. In cases such as 
  this, where a statute specifies exceptions to a general rule, no exceptions 
  other than those designated will be recognized. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">In 
  re Estate of Tilliski</span></span><span class="highlight">, 390 Ill. 273, 283, 
  61 N.E.2d 24 (1945)</span>. The appellate court was therefore correct to conclude 
  that the Medicaid Act cannot be construed as permitting the state to look to 
  the estate of a spouse of a recipient of medical assistance for reimbursement 
  of costs correctly paid on the recipient's behalf. </p>

<p class="text-level1"><strong>Rule 6. Citations </strong></p>

<p class="text-level1">Citation of Illinois cases filed prior to July 1, 2011, 
  and published in the Illinois Official Reports shall be to the Official Reports, 
  but the citation to the North Eastern Reporter and/or the Illinois Decisions 
  may be added. For Illinois cases filed on or after July 1, 2011, and for any 
  case not published in the Illinois Official Reports prior to that date and for 
  which a public-domain citation has been assigned, the public-domain citation 
  shall be given and, where appropriate, pinpoint citations to paragraph numbers 
  shall be given; a citation to the North Eastern Reporter and/or the Illinois 
  Decisions may be added but is not required. Citation of cases from other jurisdictions 
  that do not utilize a public-domain citation shall include the date and may 
  be to either the official state reports or the National Reporter System, or 
  both. If only the National Reporter System citation is used, the court rendering 
  the decision shall also be identified. For other jurisdictions that have adopted 
  a public-domain system of citation, that citation shall be given along with, 
  where appropriate, pinpoint citations to paragraph numbers; a parallel citation 
  to an additional case reporter may be given but is not required. Textbook citations 
  shall include the date of publication and the edition. Illinois statutes shall 
  generally be cited to the Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) but citations to 
  the session laws of Illinois or to the Illinois Revised Statutes shall be made 
  when appropriate.</p>
