<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Coats 

  v. State</span>, 334 Or. 587, 54 P.3d 610 (2002)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) had promulgated 

  administrative rules construing <span class="highlight">ORS 279.350(1)</span> 

  to apply to all workers at the "site of work." <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> 

  <span class="highlight">OAR 839-016-0004(19)</span>. Plaintiff and ODOT agreed 

  to incorporate those rules as terms of their contract. As explained below, central 

  to the parties' contract dispute in this case are two subsections of a BOLI 

  rule that identified the circumstances under which rock quarries, or so-called 

  "borrow pits," would be considered part of the "site of work." </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The state moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject 
  matter jurisdiction, citing <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Alto 
  v. State Fire Marshall</span>, 319 Or 382, 876 P2d 774 (1994)</span>, for the 
  proposition that a circuit court lacks jurisdiction to review the validity of 
  agency rules in the context of a declaratory judgment action. While that motion 
  was pending, ODOT withheld payments on the contract. Plaintiff then filed an 
  amended complaint in which he alleged that he had complied with the terms of 
  the contract, including the prevailing wage rules, and that ODOT's decision 
  to withhold payments was a breach of the parties' contract. In addition, because 
  ODOT's decision was based on a determination that plaintiff had failed to comply 
  with the prevailing wage rules, plaintiff argued that the circuit court had 
  acquired subject matter jurisdiction to review the validity of those rules under 
  this court's decision in <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Hay 
  v. Oregon Dep't of Transportation</span>, 301 Or 129, 719 P2d 860 (1986)</span>. 
  ODOT counterclaimed for breach of contract, and both parties then moved for 
  summary judgment. </p>
