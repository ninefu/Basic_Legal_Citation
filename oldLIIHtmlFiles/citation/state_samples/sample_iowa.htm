  v. Eng'g & Land Surveying Examining Bd.</span>, 644 N.W.2d 18 (Iowa 2002)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">There are two ways to become licensed as a professional 

  engineer in Iowa: (1) licensure by examination; and (2) licensure by comity. 

  The first method applies to applicants seeking original licensure as a professional 

  engineer in Iowa. To obtain initial licensure, an applicant must satisfy each 

  of the following requirements: </p>

<p class="text-level2"><em> a. </em>(1) Graduation from a course in engineering 

  of four years or more in a school or college which, in the opinion of the board, 

  will properly prepare the applicant for the examination in fundamental engineering 

  subjects. </p>

<p class="text-level2"> . . . . </p>

<p class="text-level2"> <em>b. </em>Successfully passing a written, oral, or written 

  and oral examination in fundamental engineering subjects which is designed to 

  show the knowledge of general engineering principles. . . . [i.e., the Fundamentals 

  of Engineering examination] </p>

<p class="text-level2"> <em>c.</em>. . . [A] specific record of four years or 

  more of practical experience in engineering work which is of a character satisfactory 

  to the board. </p>

<p class="text-level2"> <em>d. </em>Successfully passing a written, oral, or written 

  and oral examination designed to determine the proficiency and qualifications 

  to engage in the practice of engineering. . . . [i.e., the Principles and Practice 

  of Engineering examination] </p>

<p class="text-level1"> <span class="highlight">Iowa Code &#167; 542B.14(1)</span>. 
  The NCEES prepares the two examinations administered to initial licensure applicants. 
  <span class="highlight">Iowa Admin. Code r. 193C--1.4(4) (1997)</span>. Both 
  are written, uniform examinations. <em>Id. </em>The Fundamentals exam "covers 
  general engineering principles," <em>id. </em>r. 
  193C--1.4(4)(a), and is intended to satisfy the requirements of section 
  542B.14(1)(b), while the Principles and Practice exam addresses "proficiency 
  and qualification to engage in the practice of professional engineering," <em>id. 
  </em>r. 193C--1.4(4)(b), and is intended 
  to satisfy the requirements of section 542B.14(1)(d). </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Furthermore, the Board has consistently interpreted section 

  542B.20 to reject comity licensure where the applicant has not satisfied standards 

  comparable to those required of initial licensure applicants in Iowa. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See 

  <span class="highlight">Horner v. State Bd. of Eng'g Exam'rs</span></span><span class="highlight">, 

  253 Iowa 1, 8-9, 110 N.W.2d 371, 375 (1961)</span>. No evidence was produced 

  indicating the Board has issued comity licensure to an applicant who has not 

  taken an examination comparable in design to the Principles and Practice of 

  Engineering examination.</p>
