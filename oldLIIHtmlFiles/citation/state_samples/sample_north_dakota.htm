<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Zarrett 

  v. Zarrett</span>, 1998 ND 49, 574 N.W.2d 855</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">[&#182;8] A trial court has continuing power to modify an earlier 

  child support order. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">E.g.</span>, <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Steffes 

  v. Steffes</span></span><span class="highlight">, 1997 ND 49, &#182;14, 560 N.W.2d 

  888</span>; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Eklund 

  v. Eklund</span></span><span class="highlight">, 538 N.W.2d 182, 185 (N.D. 1995)</span>. 

  Child support orders are given only "limited finality," resulting in an exception 

  to the rule of claim preclusion. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Eklund</span>, 

  538 N.W.2d at 185. Thus, res judicata ordinarily will not prevent reexamination 

  of a child support order, and, if the motion to modify support comes more than 

  one year after the earlier order, <span class="highlight">N.D.C.C. &#167; 14-09-08.4(3)</span> 

  "directs the court to modify it to meet the guidelines." <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Eklund</span>, 

  538 N.W.2d at 186; <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">see also</span> <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Nelson</span>, 

  547 N.W.2d at 744. The statutory scheme clearly envisions periodic reviews 

  of child support orders to ensure support is at all times consistent with the 

  current guidelines amount. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span> <span class="highlight">N.D.C.C. 

  &#167; 14-09-08.4</span>. The trial court erred in applying the doctrine of res judicata 

  in this case.</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">[&#182;12] Robert asserts that, even if the stipulation is unenforceable, 

  the court could have nevertheless reached the same result by treating the $33,000 

  college payments as a "continued or fixed expense" over which he had no control 

  under <span class="highlight">N.D.A.C. &#167; 75-02-04.1-09(2)(j)</span>, thereby 

  rebutting the presumptively correct amount under the guidelines. The trial court 

  made no specific finding the presumptively correct amount had been rebutted, 

  as required by the guidelines. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span>, 

  <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">e.g.</span>, <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">In 

  re L.D.C.</span>, 1997 ND 104, &#182;8, 564 N.W.2d 298</span>. Furthermore, deviation 

  from the guidelines amount is appropriate only if the court first finds by a 

  preponderance of the evidence that a deviation "is in the best interest of the 

  supported children." <span class="highlight">N.D.A.C. &#167; 75-02-04.1-09(2)</span>. 

  There is no evidence in this record, nor a finding by the court, that it is 

  in Diana and David's best interest to allow Robert to pay less than the guidelines 

  amount for their support.</p>
