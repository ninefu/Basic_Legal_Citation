<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1"> &para;4 We conclude that the definition of "business closing" 

  in <span class="highlight">Wis. Stat. &#167; 109.07(1)(b)</span> does not include 

  the sale of business assets where there is no actual operational shutdown--permanent 

  or temporary--of the employment site. Where, as here, the transfer of ownership 

  continues rather than interrupts or ceases the operation of the employment site, 

  there is no "business closing" under the statute, and no 60-day notice of the 

  sale is required. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' reversal of the 

  judgment of the circuit court. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1"> &para;18 The court of appeals reversed, concluding that 
  the plain language of the statute's definition of "business closing" required 
  a "permanent or temporary shutdown of an employment site," and because the Hawkins 
  plant never shut down, there was no "business closing" within the meaning of 
  the statute. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">State 
  v. T.J. Int'l, Inc.</span></span><span class="highlight">, 2000 WI App 181, 
  &para;10, 238 Wis. 2d 173, 617 N.W.2d 256</span>. We accepted the State's petition 
  for review.</p>

<p class="text-level1"> &para;19 We review a circuit court order granting or denying 

  a motion for summary judgment independently, using the same methodology as the 

  circuit court. <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Jankee 

  v. Clark County</span>, 2000 WI 64, &para;48, 235 Wis. 2d 700, 612 N.W.2d 297</span>. 

  Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material 

  fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of 

  law. <span class="highlight">Wis. Stat. &#167; 802.08(2)</span>. </p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1"> &para;32 We note that <span class="highlight">Wis. Admin. 

  Code &#167; DWD 279.002 (Apr., 2001)</span>, entitled "Interpretation" specifies 

  that "whenever possible, this chapter will be interpreted in a manner consistent 

  with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 USC 2101 

  et seq., the federal regulations and court decisions interpreting that Act to 

  the extent that the provisions of federal and state law are the same." Both 

  defendants cite federal cases interpreting the WARN Act in support of their 

  positions. We agree with the State that none of these cases is particularly 

  helpful to our analysis of the Wisconsin law. </p>
