<h4 class="Subsection"><a name="practice"></a>Examples from <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">State 

  Comm'n on Human Relations v. Talbot County Det. Ctr.</span>, 370 Md. 115, 803 

  A.2d 527 (2002)</h4>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The Maryland Commission on Human Relations ("Commission") 

  is an independent agency charged with investigating complaints of discrimination 

  in employment, housing and public accommodations under Article 49B of the Maryland 

  Code and bringing legal and equitable actions pertaining to those violations. 

  See <span class="highlight">Md. Code (1957, 1998 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, &#167; 10</span>. 

</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">The Detention Center, in its response dated July 3, 2001, 
  asserted that the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the 
  Petition for Temporary Injunctive Relief. The Detention Center further alleged 
  that the Commission's authority to investigate was limited to the investigative 
  mechanisms set forth in <span class="highlight">Title 14, Subtitle 3 of the 
  Code of Maryland Regulations</span>. Specifically, the Detention Center argued 
  that the Commission is only allowed to: (1) require a fact-finding conference; 
  (2) require the respondent to promptly provide answers to requests for information; 
  (3) serve interrogatories on a respondent; and (4) issue subpoenas, if necessary, 
  to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of documents. 
  See <span class="highlight">COMAR 14.03.01.04</span>. With respect to the latter, 
  the Detention Center claimed that the use of the word "testimony" indicated 
  that the Commission's interviews of the witnesses should be formal recorded 
  proceedings, and thus the Commission had no authority to conduct interviews 
  confidentially and in the absence of a representative from the Detention Center. 
</p>

<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
<p class="text-level1">Maryland's anti-discrimination laws are embodied in Article 
  49B of the Maryland Code, as is the Commission's investigatory and enforcement 
  authority with respect to the anti-discrimination legislation. The Commission's 
  comprehensive investigatory powers include the authority to hold investigatory 
  hearings for fact finding, file civil actions for injunctive relief, receive 
  and issue complaints alleging discrimination, conduct investigations into discrimination 
  complaints, endeavor to reach conciliation between the parties, and initiate 
  and pursue litigationto enforce compliance. <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">See</span>

  then, cover the gamut, from investigation to commencement and pursuit of litigation.</p>
<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>

<p class="text-level1">Generally, appellate courts review a trial court's determination 

  to grant or deny injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion because trial 

  courts, sitting as courts of equity, are granted broad discretionary authority 

  to issue equitable relief. See <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">J. 

  L. Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park & Planning Comm.</span></span><span class="highlight">,

  court's decision to grant or deny injunctive relief is reviewed for an abuse 

  of discretion, "no such deference [is given] when we find 'an obvious error 

  in the application of the principles of equity'") (quoting <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE"><span class="highlight">Western
