<p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
  <p class="text-level1">&para;1 C. Johnson, J. - This case involves 
    a challenge to the Department of Revenue's (Department) interpretation of <span 
class=highlight>RCW 82.04.423</span>, which provides a tax 
    exemption for certain out-of-state sellers. Until 2000, the Department treated 
    Dot Foods, Inc. Click for Enhanced Coverage Linking Searches, an out-of-state 
    seller, as exempt from Washington's business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax. At 
    all relevant times, Dot sold consumer and nonconsumer products through its 
    direct seller's representative, Dot Transportation, Inc. (DTI), and some of the 
    consumer products ultimately ended up in permanent retail establishments. In 
    1999, in amending <span class="highlight">WAC 
      458-20-246</span>, the Department revised its interpretation of the 
    qualifications needed for the exemption. This revision changed the Department's 
    prior interpretation, and under the new interpretation, Dot no longer qualified 
    for the exemption for any of its sales. Dot filed suit challenging this 
    interpretation, and the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the 
    Department, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reverse.</p>
  <p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
  <p class="text-level1">&para;3 For many years, Dot received a 
    B&amp;O tax exemption for 100 percent of its sales pursuant to <span 
class=highlight>RCW 82.04.423</span>, which exempts from 
    the tax “gross income derived from the business of making sales at wholesale or 
    retail” if the seller meets several criteria listed in the statute. <span 
class=highlight>RCW 82.04.423(1)</span>. Among these 
    criteria, the out-of-state seller must “[m]ake[?] sales in this state 
    exclusively to or through a direct seller's representative.” <span 
class=highlight>RCW 82.04.423(1)(d)</span>. Under the 
    statute, a “direct seller's representative” is one who buys, sells, or solicits 
    the sale of consumer products in places other than a permanent retail 
    establishment. <span class="highlight">RCW 
      82.04.423(2)</span>. Between 1997 and 2000, Dot received B&amp;O tax-exempt 
    status even though it sold both consumer and nonconsumer products. Also, Dot 
    received this tax exemption during this time even though some of the products 
    purchased from Dot were later sold to permanent retail establishments without 
    Dot's or DTI's involvement.</p>
  <p class="text-level1">. . . .</p>
  <p class="text-level1">&para;14 The Department argues that its 
    statutory interpretation is entitled to judicial deference. While we give great 
    deference to how an agency interprets an ambiguous statute within its area of 
    special expertise, “such deference is not afforded when the statute in question 
    is unambiguous.” <span class="highlight"><span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">Densley v. Dep't of 
      Ret. Sys.</span>, 162 Wn.2d 210, 221, 173 P.3d 885 (2007).</span> The Department's 
    argument for deference is a difficult one to accept, considering the 
    Department's history interpreting the exemption. Initially, and shortly after 
    the statutory enactment, the Department adopted an interpretation which is at 
    odds with its current interpretation. One would think that the Department had 
    some involvement or certainly awareness of the legislature's plans to enact this 
    type of statute. As a general rule, where a statute has been left unchanged by 
    the legislature for a significant period of time, the more appropriate method to 
    change the interpretation or application of a statute is by amendment or 
    revision of the statute, rather than a new agency interpretation.</p>
