   Significant Changes in

   :
  </h3>
  <h3 class="Subsection">
   19th edition
  </h3>
  <p class="text-level1">
   The nineteenth edition made 
  even fewer significant changes than its immediate predecessor. The &quot;Bluepages,&quot; 
  the sole title now given the introductory material introduced in the eighteenth, 
  and accompanying tables expanded from forty-three pages to fifty-one. Expansion 
  and elaboration occurred throughout, most notably in the concluding set of tables 
  (which comprise over half the volume). They grew by nearly forty percent. The 
  bulk of that growth was concentrated in T2's coverage of foreign jurisdictions, 
  from the Argentine Republic to the Republic of Zambia.

   Electronic Media
  </h4>
  <p class="text-level1">
   Finally acknowledging that the Internet has for many types 
  of legal material supplanted print distribution,
   <em>
    The Bluebook
   </em>
   now sanctions 
  citation to electronic documents obtained from reliable online sources &quot;as 
  if they were the original print,&quot; permitting the omission of URL information 
  in such cases.

    The Bluebook
   </span>
   's eighteenth edition made few changes of substance. The book's format was revised; numerous rules were clarified; the 
  treatment of foreign and international materials was expanded; and the tables were 
  both added to and extended.
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    The Bluebook
   </span>
   continues to deal predominantly with the citation needs and norms of law journal 
  writing. However, the material previously relegated to nineteen pages of &quot;practitioner 
  notes&quot; has, in this latest edition, been expanded into a first section entitled &quot;An 
  Introduction to Basic Legal Citation&quot; (this work's title since its release 
  in 1993). That section is accompanied by a new set of tables furnishing references 
  to local (jurisdiction-specific) citation rules and style guides, information 
  that has been included in the
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    ALWD Guide to Legal Citation
   </span>
   from the start.

  <p class="text-level1">
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    The Bluebook
   </span>
   's 
  coverage of Internet-based material was significantly expanded and rationalized. 
  While the seventeenth edition divided Internet citations into three categories, 
  the eighteenth reduced the number to two &#8211; direct citations of material 
  accessible only online and parallel citations furnished to facilitate access 
  to material distributed in print, but not widely available in that form.

  <h4 class="Subsubsubsection">
   Introductory Signals
  </h4>
  <p class="text-level1">
   The introductory signal rule changes made by the sixteenth 

  edition were reversed in the seventeenth. Rule 1.2 now provides as it did prior 

  to 1996. "
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    E.g.
   </span>
   " is back as a separate signal 

  and "
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    contra
   </span>
   " is restored.
  </p>
  <h4 class="Subsubsubsection">
   Case Name Abbreviations
  </h4>
  <p class="text-level1">
   Rule 10.2.2 no longer spares the first or only word of a 

  party name from abbreviation if it is in the table of abbreviated words (T.6). 

  In addition, that table has been expanded.
  </p>
  <h4 class="Subsubsubsection">
   Recognition of Vendor- and Medium-Neutral Case Citations
  </h4>
  <p class="text-level1">
   Rule 10.3.3 acknowledges the spreading phenomenon of court 
  adopted vendor- and medium-neutral citation systems, requires the use of such 
  a system where the jurisdiction has adopted one. 10.3.1(b) requires the addition 
  of a parallel citation to a regional reporter even though the rule establishing 
  a vendor, medium-neutral citation system may not.
  </p>
  <h4 class="Subsubsubsection">
   Listing of Authors
  </h4>
  <p class="text-level1">
   Previously the Bluebook insisted on use of "
   <span class="ITALICSORUNDERLINE">
    et 

  al.
   </span>
   " rather than a full listing of author names when a book had more 

  than two authors. The revised Rule 15.1.1 loosens up to permit a full list when 

  "the names of the authors are relevant."
  </p>
  <h4 class="Subsubsubsection">
   Recognition of Electronic Media
  </h4>
  <p class="text-level1">
   Electronic and other nonprint resources (commercial online 
  systems, public and commercial internet sites, CD-ROM, Microform and more) have 
  been broken out of Rule 17 (which now deals only with unpublished and forthcoming 
  sources) and placed in a new Rule 18. (The former Rules 18, 19, and 20 have 
  been renumbered accordingly.)
