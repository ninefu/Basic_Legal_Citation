How to maintain the website
--------------------------------------

should we show him create example live demo tom??

Adding an example
Adding ignore-on-convert attribute
Adding a new page:
linking it to ePub ToC
linking it on angular js router
Adding link to sidebar, top navigation bars
adding search tables (this one is tricky)
making hyperlinks to point to other pages, may jump outside the site’s layout
pdf and calibre specific tags/css style updates
Upload location for the new html, epub and mobi files - the name should match the href links in index.html and location must be html/pages
anything else??

From the client’s mail:

Information on where things stand with the search feature and how to create the tags that it can search on.  I note that at present it generates no results when fed search terms drawn from the old version's index or a state name.

A report on what happened with the plan to have examples drawn from any of the state tables pulled up by entering the name of the state of interest into a search box?  Did you complete the feature sufficiently that I can implement it?  I am recalling agreement that it was better than or at least a useful tool in addition to the tables of state names.


1.    Adding a new Example
 
To add a new example in a page:
 
·         There are no separate example files with notations such as 2-100_ex0.html etc.
·         If a new example has to be added in an html file, go to the appropriate section/paragraph where the example text has to be added.
·         Follow the code conventions below to add an example either in the initial example box or in a popup.
 
Code convention to add an initial example text in the example box:
 
1.    <p class="iframe">
2.    <a name="2-100_frame_1"> </a>
3.    <div ignore-on-convert="" style="text-align: center;">
4.     <span class="Examplewindow"> § 2-110(1) Examples Window </span>
5.    </div>
6.     <div ignore-on-convert="" style="text-align: center;">
7.       <div class="ExampleBox" name="2-100_frame_1">
8.           <ul>
.
.
//Example content goes here.
.
.
9.           </ul>
10.  </div>
11.</div>
12.</p>
 
Line 1 to 12: <p> tag with class = “iframe”. Same as in the original files.
Line 2: <a> tag with the frame name. Same as in the original files.
Line 3 to 5: <div> with <span> tag contains the heading of the Example. Same as in the original files.
The ignore-on-convert attribute is explained in the next section.
Line 6 to 11: <div> tag that contains the Example box (iframe-look-alike)
Line 7 to 10: <div> tag which is the Example box. The CSS class, “ExampleBox” defines the border and the look and feel of the iframe-look-alike box.
Line 8 to 9: <ul> tag contains the list of examples in any example box. We have noticed that the examples across the website are all written in <ul> tags. In future, if this has to be changed to any other format, for example a paragraph, then the code would be:
        	<p>
.
.
//Example content goes here.
.
.
            </p>
Code convention to add an example in a popup:
 
1.  <span class="example_icon" ng-controller="dynamicExamplesCtrl">
2.        <button class="btn btn-default" ignore-on-convert=""
 			ng-click="toggleModal('Success')">«e.g.»</button>
3.        <modal visible="showModal">
4.              <ul>
.
.
//Example content goes here.
.
.
5.              </ul>
6.        </modal>
7.  </span>
Line 1: <span> tag is used to create an angularJS element for the “button-click-pop-up-open” interaction. There will be no change in this line.
Line 2: <button> tag is the substitution for the <<e.g>> hyperlink. There will not be any change in this tag.
Line 3: <modal> tag defines the popup and the content within the pop. Do not modify this in the HTML file.
Line 4: <ul> tag contains the list of examples in any example box. We have noticed that the examples across the website are all written in <ul> tags. In future, if this has to be changed to any other format, for example a paragraph, then the code would be
3.         <modal visible="showModal">
4.              <p>
.
.
//Example content goes here.
.
.
5.              </p>
6.         </modal>
Line 5: </ul> or </p> tag is the end of the example text tag.
Line 6: </modal> tag is the end of the popup definition tag.
Line 7: </span> tag ends the button and popup definition.


2.   Adding the ignore-on-convert attribute
 
We have noticed that the author has excluded the initial example textbox in the ebook versions. While converting our new website into an ebook (pdf/epub/mobi), to exclude the initial example boxes, we have written a script which skips these elements that should not appear on the ebook. This is implemented by using a special class called “ignore-on-convert”.
There are many other elements on the website which should not be present on the ebook, for example, buttons, a few hyperlinks, etc. All of these elements are given an attribute class during the website construction phase. Before conversion, a script is written which runs in the background along with the conversion to skip all these elements.
 
Code convention to add this attribute:
1.    <div ignore-on-convert="" style="text-align: center;">
2.     <span class="Examplewindow"> § 2-110(1) Examples Window </span>
3.    </div>
 
·         In this example, the entire <div> tag will be skipped and not shown in the ebook versions.
·         All the tags within the outer <div> tag will also be skipped since they are surrounded by the tag with the attribute. 

3.    Adding a new page:
      On the website:
The background skin and layout of the site is saved in html/pages/index.html

To keep a new page within this  layout:
Add an entry to the side bar as:
@html/pages/index.html



·         Linking it to ebook:
-   	If a new page has to be added to the website, update the ebook table of contents without which the changes are not reflected in the ebook.
-   	The Table of contents file can be found in the cgi-bin folder. File name “ebook-toc.html”.
-   	In the HTML file, add a list item to the existing structure of <ul> tags.
-   	Example, if a new entry called Purposes of Legal Citation has to be added and its index number is 1-200, the following code has to be added.
<li class="">
   	<span class="">
    	<a href="1-200.html">
     	§ 1-200
    	</a>
    	. Purposes of Legal Citation
   	</span>
</li>
<li><a href="#"><i class="fa fa-fw"></i> EXAMPLES –
								CITATIONS OF ...<span class="fa arrow"></span></a>
							<ul class="nav nav-second-level">
								<li><a href="#3-100">Electronic Resources</a></li>
